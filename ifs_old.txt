Sustainability Leadership and Management 

Project teams are better able to serve the community when led and managed by people and 
organizations that have a strong commitment to the principles of sustainability and resiliency and have 
demonstrated the ability to effectively incorporate these principles into projects. 

All projects must have an individual dedicated to enforcing and tracking sustainability and resiliency 
requirements. That individual should have at least 5 years of S+R experience applicable to the project 
type. Depending on the project type and scope, one individual may serve as the S+R coordinator; for 
larger or more complex projects, multiple individuals may be needed. The individual should guide the 
project team through the design and construction phases, interfacing with the construction team’s S+R 
coordinator to ensure compliance and continuity. The individual should also work with the Tyndall AFB 
project manager throughout the life of the project to ensure full compliance and accountability. 

Project Process 

A Sustainability and Resiliency Management Plan (SRMP) enables a project to set goals, objectives, and 
policies; instigate plans and programs; review performance against a plan; and take corrective actions 
across the full dimensions of sustainability. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
14004 standard for social and environmental management plans provides guidance on developing a 
Sustainability Management Plan. SRMPs should include design and construction and should allow for 
continued operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project for aspects that extend past project turnover. 

SRMPs may be stand-alone or incorporated into larger management plans. For smaller projects, 
sustainability management policies may be sufficient. The SRMP must manage the scope, scale, and 
complexity of the project’s S+R goals and describe how each must be met. The assessment is based on 
the organizational policies, authorities, mechanisms, education, and business processes put in place 
along with a determination of sufficiency. 

The SRMP must have the minimum following components: 

• 
Organizational charts and documentation showing the personnel responsible for project S+R issues, 
their position in the project organization, and their authority to make project decisions and affect 
change. 
• 
An index of all project features related to sustainability and resiliency and all aspects that require 
tracking, reporting, or other documentation. 
• 
Assessment of the project’s environmental, economic, and social impacts. This may include the 
potential for existing, non-sustainable conditions to further deteriorate environmental, economic, or 
social conditions if left unaddressed. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

• 
Prioritized list of project goals, objectives, and performance targets that consider project importance 
and the consequences of change. Goals should be aligned to objectives and targets that meet 
community needs and issues. 
• 
Documentation of a robust plan-do-check-act methodology to identify priorities, evaluate progress, 
and make adjustments to continually improve project S+R performance. 
• 
Identification of potential areas where changes in key design variables may impact future project 
performance related to S+R. Include evidence that the SRMP accounts for these potential changes 
and is adaptable. 
• 
Documentation of how the S+R requirements will be communicated to the Design Team and verified 
with the Tyndall AFB project manager. 
• 
Documentation that regular monitoring and reporting of progress against the SRMP’s goals and 
objectives is occurring throughout the design phase (for example, meetings or written reports). 
• 
Plans for how the S+R requirements will be communicated and transitioned from the design phase to 
the construction phase through methods such as construction plans, daily job briefings, subcontractor 
orientations, or onsite field training sessions. 
To create the SRMP, the S+R coordinator must develop a list of all the environmental, economic, and 
social aspects of the project that relate to sustainability and resiliency. Once established, the list of 
aspects is prioritized by the project team based on the importance of meeting project requirements. There 
may be some variations depending on the project size, type, and complexity. The SRMP must have clear 
processes and controls in place to achieve the requirements (that is, the SRMP is not solely aspirational 
in nature). Implementation of the SRMP must be revisited throughout the design phase and should be 
updated as needed and submitted as part of each major milestone submittal to Tyndall AFB. The SRMP 
should recognize that changes in socioeconomic and environmental conditions have the potential to 
significantly impact projects. SRMPs and their subsequent performance goals take these changing 
conditions into account. 

Starting in pre-design, but no later than the start of the conceptual design phase, the project’s S+R 
coordinator must develop the initial SRMP document. The SRMP should encompass all aspects related 
to the design phase of the project and should also plan for the integration of the contractor. At the start of 
the construction phase, the SRMP should be transferred to the contractor where it must then update the 
content with how the construction team intends to assimilate the SRMP components and execute all 
requirements. The contractor should provide the updated version to the Design Team’s S+R Coordinator 
and to the Tyndall AFB project manager. The contractor’s coordinator must provide regular updates to the 
same individuals throughout the construction phase, as well as a final version including end results of all 
initiatives to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record.

01 33 29 Sustainability Reporting 

Provide documentation for Guiding Principles Validation for all buildings. Horizontal infrastructure does 
not require third party certification, but still must provide relevant sustainability documentation as listed in 
01 61 00 Common Product Requirements. Additional Sustainability Requirements for the program include 
mandated reporting on Sustainability, Resilience and Smart Technology Key Performance Indicators. 

01 35 00 Special Procedures 

Projects at Tyndall AFB can exceed minimum regulatory requirements and improve health and safety on 
the project site, surrounding areas, and broader communities. Project teams cannot always eliminate 
risks to health and safety, but can demonstrate that both the benefits and exposure to risks associated 
with the project are not disproportionately burdened for one group of users over another. Having and 
promoting a common focus on health and safety throughout the construction industry has benefits that 
extend beyond the individual project. 

Since projects teams governed by this IFS update may encounter requirements that may not be present 
in typical criteria, project teams should conduct hazard analyses and develop construction safety plans to 
address risks associated with using new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies. The components 
of these requirements address safety procedures for onsite workers, personnel training and development, 
and site and information security. These themes not only protect the individuals working on the site, they 
help to maintain safe and secure operations of the asset and provide a foundation for proper O&M of the 
facility. 

Design Team – Vertical Projects 

Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to 
achieve safety and health synergies across disciplines and across two key building life-cycle stages 
described below. Use the analyses to inform the Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR), basis of design 
(BOD), design documents, and construction documents. 

Perform safety design reviews before the completion of schematic design to explore how the completed 
building will be operated and maintained over its expected lifetime. Use a life-cycle safety approach to 
explore how to reduce hazards and improve efficiency and well-being for building O&M personnel. 
Assess each of the following systems where applicable: 

• 
Roof Systems. Assess how personnel will access the roof for operations, inspection, and 
maintenance; the distance of equipment and feature locations (including some types of cool roofs, 
vegetated roofs, and solar panel installations) to roof edge; equipment installation and replacement 
access (including point loading); water and power access for vegetated roofs; and the need for 
installation of fall protection measures. 
• 
Equipment Rooms and Systems. Assess how personnel will access equipment and controls 
needing servicing; any work at height or in confined spaces; need for sufficient clearances to 
electrical or other equipment; equipment installation and replacement access; chemical storage 
needs; and fall protection, eye wash, or other safety feature needs. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

• 
Building Exterior Enclosure and Daylighting Systems. Assess how personnel will clean exterior 
(e.g. cladding including windows and exterior shading devices) skylights and interior atria features. 
• 
Storage and Collection of Recyclables. Assess the need for O&M workers to manually handle 
recyclables. Assess measures needed for handling of hazardous waste streams that could contain 
batteries, sharp edges, mercury-containing lamps, or similar items. 
• 
Special Features. If applicable, assess rainwater management cisterns, energy recovery wheels, or 
geothermal wells for confined space hazards. Assess access, confined space, and fall exposures for 
underfloor air distribution systems. 
Document how the reviews led to incorporating at least one protective measure for each system into 
design and building feature decisions in the project’s OPR and BOD, including the following, as 
applicable: 

• 
Building roof designs (for example, use of parapets, guard rails, setbacks, fall protection) 
• 
Equipment room and recyclable storage area design and layout 
• 
Exterior enclosure, daylighting, and special feature designs 
• 
Safe O&M plans for submittal to Owner, including recommendations where applicable for use of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as foot, head, eye and face, ear, respiratory, and fall 
protection 
Have a construction safety specialist perform safety constructability reviews before the completion of 
schematic design to explore and plan how safety and efficiency can be optimized during construction. If 
feasible, engage a general contractor and key trade contractors and suppliers improves planning and 
allows consideration of options such as prefabrication and modularization that can improve construction 
employee safety, construction efficiency, and downstream maintenance efficiency and safety. Assess the 
following topic areas where applicable: 

• 
Site Conditions. Assess site hazards such as presence of overhead power lines or brownfieldrelated 
soil exposures relevant to foundation work. 
• 
Building Reuse. Assess potential hazards arising out of reuse, ranging from structural safety and 
deconstruction safety to the presence of hazardous materials such as lead, asbestos, or mold. 
• 
Construction Activity Pollution Prevention. Assess how the Pollution Prevention Plan can be used 
to further reduce exposures to construction employees. For example, use local exhaust ventilated 
tools and/or wet method controls on all outdoor dust-generating tools and equipment to reduce 
exposures from silica, welding, and other construction contaminants at the source. 
• 
Construction Indoor Air Quality Management. Assess how the Indoor Air Quality Management 
Plan can be used to further reduce exposures to construction employees. For example, use local 
exhaust ventilated tools and/or wet method controls on all indoor dust-generating tools and 
equipment to reduce exposures from silica, welding, and other construction contaminants at the 
source. 
• 
Waste Recycling Management. Assess construction worker handling of construction wastes, and 
incorporate measures (for example, the use of motorized equipment) to minimize potential for manual 
handling injuries into waste management plans. 
• 
Materials and Resources. Assess the utility of low-emitting materials, material ingredient reporting, 
chemical of concern avoidance, and source reduction approaches to further reduce construction 
worker exposures. 
• 
Working at Heights. Assess and minimize the need for working at heights. Where appropriate, use 
permanent fall prevention features developed during O&M safety design review. Plan for general 
contractors to employ 100% fall protection during the construction phase. 
• 
Special Features. If applicable, assess construction safety and sequence issues (for example, fall 
hazards, and confined space hazards) related to vegetated and cool roofs, installation of solar panels,

Compile the above documentation into an organized format and provide to the Tyndall AFB project 
manager for record. 

Construction Team – All Projects 

The contractor must designate a Safety Officer accountable for safety performance on the project 
construction site. This individual must maintain a professional credential in construction worksite safety 
granted by an independent third-party safety authority or accreditation program. The Safety Officer must 
document all reportable injuries and illnesses on the Occupational Health and Safety Administration 
(OSHA) Form 300, scoped specifically to include reportable information for the project only. The OSHA 
300 form can be accessed here: osha.gov/recordkeeping/new-osha300form1-1-04.pdf. 

Project Safety Plan 

The contractor’s Safety Officer and management team members must develop a Project Safety Plan 
(PSP) representative of the entire duration of the project and includes the following minimum 
components: 

• 
Documentation that the Owner and contractor have a site-specific safety plan and a PSP. This plan 
may include, but is not limited to, contractor background checks on personnel working on the project, 
and 24-hour security monitoring on the project (physical/electronic). The security plan should be 
appropriate to the size and scope of the project. 
For small projects (less than $5 million in cost), Owners and contractors may substitute general site 
security policies for the site-specific plan. 

A short narrative that describes the goals of the PSP and how the PSP will be implemented and used 
to manage safety on the project. Include documentation showing the Owner and contractors 
developed a proactive investigative process that focuses on root-cause and corrective actions rather 
than disciplinary actions and financial penalties. 

• 
A list or table of all major construction operations occurring within the work zone, including dates and 
locations of each operation. 
– Documentation of safety and/or security competency training programs, either online or in person, 
for field personnel, including type of training provided and how they specifically target health and 
safety. Training may include task-specific safety training or general awareness training. 
– Documentation of minimum training requirements for health and safety programs, such as 
occupational safety and health, first aid, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, emergency response, 
and active shooter training. 
• 
A description of the sequence for each operation. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

• 
A list or table that identifies all potential hazards associated with each step in the sequence of each 
operation. 
• 
A list of preventive actions for each potential hazard. 
• 
A list of any individuals or parties responsible for implementing preventive actions. 
– Include documentation showing contractors developed program requirements to ensure 
subcontractors maintain a high level of safety per the contract. 
– Include documentation showing Owners and contractors have an incident review process that 
involves all levels of management to validate corrective measures to minimize future injuries and 
incidents on the job site. 
• 
Documentation that contractors develop “lessons learned” reports that allow other contractors and 
projects the opportunity to review the fact-finding of an incident and implement processes and 
procedures to minimize similar incidents on the job site. 
• 
A description of miscellaneous or additional hazards that may be present within or adjacent to the 
work zone and an appropriate means of abatement or prevention. 
Record any changes to the PSP throughout the construction process with an explanatory narrative 
describing circumstances, if necessary. Compile the above documentation into an organized format and 
provide to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record at the completion of construction. 

01 50 00 Temporary Construction Facilities and Controls 

Construction projects at Tyndall AFB must reduce and prevent disturbances to surrounding environments 
and communities due to construction activities. Such efforts must address noise, vibration, light, and 
glare. All projects impact their surrounding environments; however, infrastructure projects are usually 
long-term projects that may take years to complete construction. During this time, it is important for the 
project to have minimal negative impacts on the surrounding community. 

The contractor must therefore establish, implement, and maintain a formal Construction Impact Mitigation 
Plan (CIMP) during construction for the prime contractor. The CIMP must be in place at the beginning of 
construction activities and cover all project activities, including subcontractor work. 

The CIMP must address, at minimum, the following construction impacts together as one plan or as 
separate plans: noise, vibration, light, glare, and other activities anticipated to create nuisance or 
disturbance to surrounding communities. 

For each type of impact: 

• 
Identify the responsible party for mitigation activities, their contact information, their responsibilities, 
and their qualifications. Include information if any portions of the CIMP were prepared by an outside 
party. 
• 
Identify the location and distance to the closest receptors for noise, vibration, light, and glare. 
• 
Describe the surrounding zoning and parcel information (for example, commercial, residential, 
hospitals, schools, parks, and sensitive habitat). 
• 
List proposed construction activities (for example, demolition, excavation, paving, bridge foundations, 
and finishing). 
• 
Identify dates and working hours of proposed construction activities. 
• 
List noise-, vibration-, light-, glare-or other nuisance-generating devices used during construction. 
• 
List mitigating devices and reduction strategies used during each construction activity, including: 
– For noise and vibration, specifically, specifications for minimizing construction noise and vibration 
should meet or exceed accepted local practices. 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

– PPE requirements for all site employees. 
– A map showing the locations of any installed controls (include mitigating devices or strategies for 
construction phase activities only). 
• 
Identify procedures for inspection and maintenance of preventive measures and site controls. 
• 
Include permit numbers and agency or local authority policies associated with construction work, as 
applicable. 
• 
Describe monitoring standards, methods, and acceptable levels. 
• 
Describe corrective procedures for non-compliance. Document feedback mechanisms in place for 
receiving and responding to public and stakeholder concerns during construction. The construction 
contractor is expected to work with affected neighbors to develop construction plans as well as 
monitoring and corrective action programs. 
• 
Outline expected staff training needs. 
• 
Include the signature of the responsible party or parties. 
Record any modifications to the CIMP and provide supporting evidence of the monitoring activities that 
occur throughout construction. Maintain changes to the CIMP in the document so the reader can see the 
evolution of the CIMP throughout the project. The contractor must submit a final CIMP to the Tyndall AFB 
project manager for record. 

01 57 23 Temporary Stormwater Pollution Control 

Comply with Construction General Permit(CGP) requirements. Coordinate sequencing of work, use of 
common soil stockpile areas, and construction stormwater pollution best management practices (BMPs) 
with the PMO to accommodate work of other contractors. 

Tyndall AFB projects have a responsibility to protect receiving waters (including surface water, 
groundwater, and stormwater systems), air quality, and public safety by preventing and minimizing the 
discharge of construction site pollutants and materials. This is especially true of the water aspects, given 
the immediate adjacency to coastal and wetland areas. 

Requirements 

For all projects, the Design Team must create and implement an Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollutant 
Control Plan, commonly referred to as a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) or Erosion and 
Sedimentation Control Plan (ESCP) for all construction activities associated with the project. Regardless 
of project size, the plan (SWPPP or ESCP) must conform to erosion and sedimentation requirements of 
the most current version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Construction General Permit 
or local erosion and sedimentation control standards and codes, whichever is more stringent. 

The SWPPP or ESC must list the BMPs employed and describe how the BMPs accomplish the following 
objectives: 

• 
Prevent loss of soil during construction by stormwater runoff or wind erosion, including protecting 
topsoil by stockpiling or covering for reuse. 
• 
Prevent and reduce sediment discharges into storm conveyances, receiving waters, or other public 
infrastructure components or systems. 
• 
Prevent polluting the air with dust and particulate matter. 
• 
Prevent runoff and infiltration of other pollutants from construction sites (for example, thermal 
pollution, concrete wash, fuels, solvents, hazardous chemical runoff, high or low pH discharges, and 
pavement sealants) and ensure proper disposal of all construction-related materials. 
• 
Protect any Vegetation and Soil Protection Zones (VSPZs) and other areas of vegetation that will 
remain onsite during construction activities. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

Note: The construction phase of the project is considered complete when the site is stabilized, a notice of 
termination is filed, or a notice of substantial completion is issued. 

The CGP outlines the provisions necessary to comply with Phase I and Phase II of the EPA National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program (or local equivalent for projects outside the 
United States). Although the CGP applies only to sites greater than one acre (0.40 hectare), its 
requirements are applied to all Tyndall AFB projects. 

Recommended Strategies 

Employ strategies such as a combination of temporary and permanent seeding, mulching, earth dikes, 
sediment traps, sediment basins, filter socks, compost berms and blankets, secondary containment, spill 
control equipment, hazardous waste manifests, and overfill alarms. Include the following aspects, as 
appropriate to each project type: 

• 
Erosion and sedimentation control 
– Providing natural buffers 
– Installing perimeter controls 
– Minimizing sediment track-out 
– Controlling discharges from stockpiled sediment or soil 
– Minimizing dust 
– Minimizing the disturbance of steep slopes 
– Preserving topsoil 
– Minimizing soil compaction 
– Protecting storm drain inlets 
• 
Maintaining control measures 
o 
Stabilization 
• 
Deadlines for initiating and completing stabilization 
• 
Criteria for stabilization 
o 
Pollution prevention 
• 
Prohibited discharges 
• 
General maintenance requirements 
• 
Pollution prevention standards 
• 
Emergency spill notification 
• 
Fertilizer discharge restrictions 
• 
Implement post-construction stormwater management with construction 
sequencing (such as infiltration systems constructed or rehabilitated at the end of 
the project); account for weather conditions during construction activities to 
minimize unintended chemical dispersal or other adverse effects on and offsite 
(such as apply pavement sealers and perform mass-grading operations only 
when no rain is predicted) 
The contractor must establish control measures before construction begins and implement additional 
measures as needed based on site conditions and as construction progresses. The establishment and 
maintenance of ESCP measures are generally the responsibility of the general contractor or builder. At a 
minimum, the contractor must provide regular inspections and documentation updates to show progress. 
If any issues arise, the issue must be documented along with what remedial measures were implemented 
to alleviate the issue. 

• 
Monitor control measures periodically through site inspections and record maintenance activities 
taken during construction. 
• 
Inspections must be recorded regularly via date-stamped photographs, inspection reports, or other 
recording processes. 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

The following actions are also recommended: 

• 
Any problems identified in site inspections should be resolved in a timely manner. 
• 
All subcontractors should promptly notify the responsible party if they see damage to an ESCP 
measure. 
• 
Generate and save documentation as the SWPPP or ESC is implemented for compilation in the final 
report. 
Submittal Documentation 

The Design Team must provide the following to the S+R Coordinator, and these must be a component of 
the final construction documents: 

• 
The SWPPP, ESCP, or other local required plan (whichever is more stringent). If a local standard has 
been followed, provide documentation to demonstrate the local standard is equal to or more stringent 
than the referenced NPDES program. 
• 
Site plan showing the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite. 
The contractor must provide the following construction-related content: 

• 
Key pollution prevention personnel and their responsibilities and qualifications

– For zero lot line projects and projects with minimal or no exterior work: Description of special 
conditions and compliance with any applicable ESCP measures 
• 
Video or photos that document the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite 
• 
Video or photos that document any issues that arise, as well as documentation showing their 
corrective actions; include information regarding the timeframe between initial offense and correction 
Final SWPPP/ESCP documentation must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. 

01 61 00 Common Product Requirements 

Requirements listed herein apply to materials and products that will be used on all project types under the 
guidance of the IFS. Design Teams must follow the criteria below in the identification of qualifying 
components for inclusion in final full design specifications and project drawings. Designers must 
communicate these requirements as well as requirements to track material and product data to project 
contractors. This section enables projects to exceed the minimum requirements set forth in various 
Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) that include sustainable and resilient product attributes, including those 
from UFC 1-200-02. 

All Projects 

All project types must develop a Material and Product Plan. The Material and Product Plan must be 
developed by the Design Team and communicated to the construction team, who will be responsible for 
implementation. The Design Team must identify a pool of qualifying materials and products so as not to 
sole source and violate Federal project procurement regulations. The Material and Product Plan must 
contain tracking mechanisms developed by the Design Team as appropriate to each project. The 
mechanisms must be provided to the contractor for use throughout construction. At project completion,

the tracking information—including supporting vendor/manufacturer product information—must be 
provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. 

Reduce Net Embodied Carbon 

Project teams must strive to reduce embodied carbon associated with each project type; plans for 
implementation must be included in the Material and Product Plan. This approach combines concepts of 
sourcing local materials, using materials more efficiently, and using lower-impact materials in order to 
reduce the combined environmental impacts of material use. In the required calculations, carbon is used 
as a proxy unit of measure to compare various impacts across the entire supply chain of material 
consumption. One stage of this supply chain involves raw material extraction/harvesting, refinement, and 
manufacturing into products. The second involves transportation of the materials from the manufacturer to 
their final destination onsite. By designing projects to use less material, use material efficiently, or 
specifying materials with lower embodied carbon, as well as reducing transportation distances, project 
teams can reduce the overall impact of the project. 

Availability of data on the carbon intensity of materials is often limited, and some projects may involve 
hundreds or thousands of products. Therefore, acceptable documentation may take a streamlined 
approach for conducting calculations for this requirement. Project teams may identify a select list of 
primary materials/products that collectively make up greater than 80% of the total embodied carbon. If 
data on embodied carbon or material intensity is not available from the manufacturer, project teams may 
use averages or generalized data from studies or material databases. Project teams should track, 
document, and clearly explain their methodology for calculating material intensity. The resulting narrative 
must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. 

Transportation of materials to project sites can be a significant contributor to the embodied carbon of 
materials. Local or regional materials—even materials sourced or processed onsite—reduce the impact of 
long transport and support local economies. It is important to note that while it is generally desirable to 
use locally sourced materials for the aforementioned reasons, use of local materials could have negative 
impacts on performance if those materials result in reduced durability, safety, or service life. Carbon 
emissions associated with the transportation of materials to the project site are specifically broken out as 
they are often simpler to calculate based on distance; quantity; and standard truck, air, rail, or shipping 
fuel consumption. Carbon emissions are also calculated separately to show the possible conflicts that 
exist of sourcing a lower-intensity material from farther away. Project teams should consider choices that 
reduce the overall net embodied carbon of materials. 

Documentation must include the following: 

• 
Determination of materials that are the primary contributors to embodied carbon for the project during 
construction and operation. 
– Documentation of the primary materials to be used in the construction and ongoing operation of 
the project over its life. Documentation should include: 
• 
The materials used. 
• 
General estimates of the quantities of materials used. 
Note that operations materials may need to be multiplied by the frequency of use over the 
project life. Material estimates should include anticipated repairs/upkeep (for example, road 
resurfacing). 
• 
Estimates of the embodied carbon of materials. 
Estimates may use readily available public information such as regional, national, or global 
averages. 
– Identification of the select materials that collectively will make up more than 80% of the total 
estimated embodied carbon of the project. 
• 
Calculations of the primary contributors to overall embodied carbon and an index of the embodied 
carbon calculations of the primary contributors to carbon intensity over the life of the project 
(construction and operations). This should include: 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

– Carbon emissions to produce the material, including raw material extraction, refinement, and 
manufacture including secondary or tertiary processing. 
– Carbon emissions from transporting the material from the manufacturer to the project site, 
including intermediary points. 
– Embodied carbon data may come from the manufacturer, reputable databases, reputable 
embodied energy software, or from project team calculations. If the source or specific type of 
materials is not known at the time of assessment, calculations may present a range of values or 
rely on likely material choices. Calculations should be in tons carbon dioxide (CO2). 
• 
Narrative explaining the project’s reduction of the net embodied carbon of materials used in 
construction and operation. 
– Documentation that the project has set targets for reducing net embodied carbon. 
– Documentation of strategies/plans to reduce net embodied carbon. These may include, but are 
not limited to: 
• 
Sizing the project to require less material. 
• 
Designing the project to use less material. 
• 
Choosing materials that have lower embodied carbon. 
• 
Reducing material needed for repair and maintenance. 
• 
Reducing material waste during construction. 
• 
Reducing material waste during operation. 
• 
Sourcing local materials to reduce transportation emissions. 
• 
Using lower-carbon transportation modes. 
– Calculations of reductions in embodied carbon achieved. Calculations should compare total 
carbon intensity of materials for the project against the total carbon intensity of the baseline. 
Calculations should be in tons CO2. 
Horizontal Projects 

Use Recycled Materials 

Using recycled, reused, and renewable materials and products—including existing structures and 
materials onsite—reduces demand for virgin materials and the embodied carbon emissions and 
environmental degradation attributed to their extraction and processing. Using these materials also 
reduces waste and supports the market for recycled and reused materials. Horizontal projects must use a 
minimum of 40% (by weight, volume, or cost) of recycled materials including materials with recycled 
content and/or reused existing structures or materials per individual project scope. Projects that lack 
applicable scope to meet this requirement must provide a narrative indicating justification to their 
Tyndall AFB project manager for consideration. Include descriptive narrative and tracking mechanisms in 
the Material and Product Plan. 

Suggested Strategies 

Reduce the amount of new pavement materials needed through soil stabilization methods to reduce the 
required thickness of a new pavement or processes that incorporate existing pavement structures into 
new pavement structures. The area treated is calculated based on the entire area of existing preserved or 
reconstructed pavement materials. 

Soil stabilization methods may include the use of geosynthetics (geogrids and fabrics) to reduce the 
thickness of aggregate required for stabilization of subgrade; the use of geosynthetics to reduce the 
thickness of aggregate above the geosynthetics that would have been required for structural support 
when subgrade soils are susceptible to pumping and base course intrusion; the use of Portland cement 
and/or cementitious by-product materials for soil stabilization for pavement construction, if it can be 
demonstrated that this process will reduce the use of natural aggregate (virgin aggregate or material 
hauled from off-site source) use for stabilization; other chemical stabilization; and fractured slab 
techniques, including crack-and-seat, and rubblization. 

04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

Use recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) or recycled concrete aggregate (RAP or RCA) in new pavement 
lifts or granular base course or embankments. The recycled materials can originate from the project or 
other areas at Tyndall AFB or surrounding areas, and be recycled onsite or offsite. 

Average recycled content (ARC) must be calculated per the following calculation: 

Where: 
ARC 
(%) 
= 
(S 
rn 
/ 
S 
Wn) 
x 
100% 


– rn = the total weight or volume of RAP or RCA 
– Wn = the total weight or volume of either all existing pavement materials or all bedding, backfill, 
and granular embankment materials per the method of recycling used 
– n = the number of materials considered in accordance with the method used 
Recycle pavement materials in place using cold-in-place recycling, hot-in-place recycling, and full depth 
reclamation methods. 

Reuse the subbase granular material of existing pavement elements as subgrade embankment or as part 
of the new subbase during construction of the proposed new pavement structure. 

Relocate and reuse at least 90% of the minor structural elements that meet current code, including 
existing luminaires, signal poles, and sign structures required to be removed and/or relocated onsite or by 
the agency. 

Calculations of recycled materials can be done by weight, volume, or cost, but must remain consistent 
throughout the project. Calculations should compare the total quantity of recycled materials and reused 
structures with the total quantity of materials on the project. Products that contain a percentage of 
recycled material should be factored according to the percentage of material that is recycled. 

Recycled content is defined in accordance with ISO 14021 as the portion of materials used in a product 
that have been diverted from the solid waste stream and used in part or whole in place of a new primary 
material. Material eligible for consideration can also be defined as pre-existing material onsite, or from 
another site, that was previously a product or piece of equipment that is now being repurposed or reused. 

To track contributing materials and efforts, project teams must coordinate between designers and 
contractors to generate the following documentation for submission to the Tyndall AFB project manager: 

• 
Total quantity of materials used on the project by weight, volume, or cost. 
• 
Inventory of specifications for materials containing recycled content. Inventory should include the 
name of the product, the name of the manufacturer, the weight, volume, or cost of the material, and 
the percentage of recycled content (either post-industrial or post-consumer recycled content). 
• 
Calculations of percentage of reused or recycled materials by weight, volume, or cost. To calculate 
materials with recycled content, multiply the material weight, volume, or cost by the percentage of 
recycled content. Mechanical, electrical, water equipment, and their components may be excluded 
from the calculations. In these instances, the most efficient equipment should be specified. 
Calculations do not include plants, soils, rocks, or water. 
• 
Inventory of existing materials or structures that have been reused. Design documents showing the 
location and weight, volume, or cost of reused structures or materials. In determining weight, volume, 
or cost, the project team may refer to standard equivalents. The project team must be able to 
demonstrate an intentional choice to salvage materials or structures that might otherwise have been 
sent to landfills and/or replaced. Provide a narrative to accompany the above required calculations.

01 74 19 Construction Waste Management and Disposal 

Waste management services vary widely from one location to another; therefore, teams should begin by 
identifying the technologies, haulers, and facilities reasonably available in the Tyndall area. Planning for 
construction waste management (CWM) before construction allows time to identify the most effective 
waste diversion strategies available. Such strategies typically include reuse, recycling, donation, and 
salvage; however, source reduction and source separation are also viable and effective. Source reduction 
eliminates project waste through prefabrication, modular construction, or incorporating standard material 
lengths or sizes into construction documents. Source separation sorts waste onsite into recycling 
streams, ensuring delivery to the correct facility. Retaining construction and demolition materials onsite 
reduces the cost of disposal at a landfill. Rather than viewing them as “waste,” using construction and 
demolition materials as resources for new site development reduces the need for and costs associated 
with purchasing new materials such as wood, concrete and other types of masonry, and drywall. 

All projects must develop and implement a Construction and Demolition Waste Management Plan 
(CDWMP). The CDWMP must account for all materials, including land-clearing debris, materials to be 
used for alternative daily cover (ADC), and other materials not contributing to diversion but not included in 
the diverted waste total. Material sent to landfills for use as cover is still being disposed of in landfills and 
therefore does not meet the intent of this effort. The safe removal and disposal of hazardous materials 
must also be covered in the CDWMP. Hazardous materials must be tracked separately and not be 
included in the project’s total waste. 

• 
Horizontal projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 50% of structural materials, and 
75% of road and infrastructure materials. 
• 
Vertical projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 85%, attained through any 
combination of strategies appropriate to the project type and scope. 
Diversion rate = (Total waste diverted from landfill / Total waste produced by project) × 100 
• 
Establish waste diversion goals for the project by identifying at least five materials (both structural and 
nonstructural) targeted for diversion. Approximate a percentage of the overall project waste that these 
materials represent. 
– It may be easiest to focus on determining the heaviest waste or the waste that generates the 
most volume. 
– For Horizontal projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include materials 
composted onsite or sent to a composting facility, the use of material, if appropriate, as infill, 
Portland cement concrete, and ferrous and non-ferrous metals. 
• 
Non-composted and non-organic materials should not be added to soil as an amendment 
unless these materials can be demonstrated to benefit site soils and planned vegetation. 
– For Vertical projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include drywall, acoustical 
ceiling tiles, carpet and other flooring, wood, scrap metals, brick, and concrete. 
• 
Finish materials, such as flooring and ceiling tiles, can often be recycled through the major 
manufacturers via take-back programs. 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

• 
Consider incorporating reuse of finish materials, furniture, or framing into the design early. 
Reusing existing materials may require design modifications. Some materials must remain 
intact to be reused (for example, drywall) or may require additional preparation (for example, 
de-nailing). 
– Source reduction strategies should be incorporated into the design of the project and outlined in 
the CWM plan. These strategies include modular construction, reduced packaging, using 
industry-standard measurements, and prefabrication. 
• 
Specify whether materials will be separated or commingled at the project site and describe the 
diversion strategies planned for the project. Describe where the material will be taken and how the 
recycling facility will process the material. 
– Projects may use a combination of onsite separation and commingled collection, depending on 
what is appropriate for the project location, material stream, and available facilities and haulers. 
• 
For onsite separation, common CWM strategies include donation, resale, onsite reuse, 
recycling, or refurbishment. Crushing asphalt, concrete, and masonry for infill or aggregate is 
also considered onsite waste diversion. 
• 
The most common offsite strategies are incineration, combustion of wood, and sending 
commingled waste to a sorting facility. Include wood waste converted to fuel (biofuel) in the 
calculations; other types of waste-to-energy are not considered diversion for this effort. 
– Establish onsite infrastructure, practices, and policies for offsite sorting, and develop a tracking 
system. 
• 
Track all the construction and demolition waste leaving the site. Retain waste hauler reports for 
documentation. Record estimated weight or volume of materials reused onsite or salvaged for reuse 
on other projects by subcontractors or vendors. 
• 
Retain receipts and estimate weight or volume for materials donated to charities, reuse retailers, or 
other recipients that can verify and track incoming and outgoing materials. 
At project construction completion, the construction team must provide a final, revised report detailing all 
major waste streams generated, including disposal and diversion rates, and all backup documentation, 

i.e. hauling receipts and monthly summaries from the hauler. 
01 80 00 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS 

Energy Performance 

Comply with Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10 Part 433” Energy Efficiency Standards for New 
Federal Commercial and Multi-Family High-Rise Residential Buildings’ Baseline Standards” (Update 6 
Nov 2015). Commercial buildings must be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are 30% 
less than the consumption levels of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 baseline building. 

New buildings and major renovations of existing buildings are to reduce fossil fuel-generated energy 
consumption 80% in FY 2020, 90% in FY 2025, and 100% in FY 2030, compared to a FY 2003 baseline. 

Federal low-rise residential buildings must be designed and constructed in compliance with the 
International Code Council 2015 International Energy Conservation Code. 

Install metering and advanced metering devices in accordance with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
Metering Guidance, November 2014, or subsequent updates. 

Achieving Best-In-Class energy performance is required and should include the following components: 

• 
Reduced operating costs through reduced energy consumption 
• 
Enhanced resilience through reduced requirements for energy and water 
• 
Enhanced resilience through passive survivability

• 
Improved occupant comfort and productivity 
• 
Significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions 
• 
Simplification of powering buildings with renewable energy and energy storage

Mitigation of the risk of future energy cost volatility 
•

• 
Mitigation of the risk of future climate changes such as greater peak cooling loads 
Tyndall AFB is in Climate Zone 2A, and it is cooling dominated. ASHRAE research and publications 
indicate that a target Energy Use Intensity at Tyndall AFB can be 22 thousand British thermal units per 
square foot (kBtu/ft2) per year, site energy, for a typical office building. Allowances can be made for the 
type of building, hours of operation, and USAF-driven process loads, but this is where best-in-class 
energy performance starts, and it is the baseline for energy performance. 

This level of energy performance is to be achieved through the use of integrated design strategies where 
all design, construction and operations personnel think of the building as a system, not as individual 
components. Interdisciplinary solutions must be identified that result in savings that dwarf component-
based efficiencies. Well thought-out, cost-effective, simple-to-maintain strategies must result in the 
downsizing of HVAC equipment, artificial lighting, and electrical systems to provide low energy 
performance with a conventional budget. Energy modeling must be initiated early in the process, and the 
model must be continually updated as design options are considered and selected. 

In summary, the approach to achieving a low-energy-consuming building starts with the building 
envelope, where the interior environment is separated from the exterior. Buildings will include high “R” 
value, thermally broken, well air-sealed assemblies to minimize the skin load. Hygro-thermal analysis 
should be included to identify condensation and mold issues as well. Next, the internal loads created by 
USAF equipment must be as efficient as possible to minimize the energy requirements. Efficient heating, 
cooling, ventilation, and lighting are to be provided only where needed, when needed, and rarely for 
unoccupied spaces. Equipment to provide heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting must be high-
efficiency type, and ventilation requirements should be separated from sensible heating and cooling. 

In Tyndall AFB’s climate zone, the cooling load can be expected to represent two thirds of a building’s 
energy consumption. Efforts to reduce the cooling loads must include the following: 

• 
Attention to orientation and massing. An east-west orientation significantly contributes to avoiding 
unwanted solar gain while providing opportunities for effective daylighting strategies that reduce the 
need for artificial lighting. 
• 
A window-to-wall ratio maximum of 30% with reduced glazing on the east and west facades 
compared to the north and south facades. Glazing must be well placed for daylighting and views. 
• 
Appropriate shading of fenestration to prevent solar gain and glare. 
• 
High R-value opaque wall assemblies. 
• 
Continuous exterior insulation to create a thermal break. This includes slabs and foundations, as well 
as roofs and wall assemblies. Pay attention to balconies, parapets, and similar. 
• 
Incorporating cool roofs. 
• 
A continuous air barrier throughout all six sides of the building. The air barrier must be tested in 
accordance with ASTM E779, and the infiltration must not exceed 0.15 cubic foot per minute per 
square foot (cfm/ft2) of envelope at 75 Pascals (Pa). 
• 
The lighting power density must be no more than 0.4 watt per square foot (ft2) for the overall building; 
for individual areas, the wattage per square foot must match the criteria as defined in ASHRAE/ 
Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) Standard 90.1. Lighting controls, to include occupancy 
sensors, photocell control, daylight harvesting, bilevel dimming, and similar, must minimize power 
consumption and eliminate lighting of unoccupied spaces. Use task lighting with vacancy sensors to 
supplement low ambient light levels.

• 
Equipment and appliances must be ENERGY STAR rated, and careful attention must be paid to the 
reduction of plug loads through the optimization of office equipment, copy rooms, vending and 
kitchenettes. 
HVAC systems will vary based on building type and size. They must be right sized to avoid inefficient 
operation at part load, and they must be high-efficiency systems. The fact that a high-performance air 
barrier and envelope is required gives the HVAC system designer the confidence needed to downsize 
systems. Where possible, ventilation requirements must be decoupled from sensible heating 
requirements, and energy recovery ventilation must be used. Demand controlled ventilation must be used 
where appropriate, such as in often unoccupied assembly areas. Focus should be placed on simplifying 
systems and downsizing equipment through load reduction. An effort to minimize the maintenance 
requirements must be included through the use of simple strategies such as heat pipes for heat recovery. 
Economizers and free cooling must be used when possible. 

Service water heating loads must be minimized through water conservation. Plumbing fixtures must be 
Water Sense labelled with particular attention paid to fixtures using hot water. Compact plumbing plans 
must be provided where possible, and efficient service water heating equipment must be specified. 

01 81 10 Sustainable and Resilient Design Requirements 

Summary 

The requirements delineated herein and throughout the Divisions encompass those applicable to both 
S+R at Tyndall AFB and are applicable to all project types. These criteria exceed the requirements of the 
following sections in the Pre-Final IFS: 

• 
B.02.3 
• 
C01.1 
• 
C04.1 
• 
C06.1.4 
• 
D.02 
• 
D03.2 
• 
E.01 

Project Certification 

A standard requirement of all DoD building projects is to comply with UFC 1-200-02, High Performance 
and Sustainable Building (HPSB) Requirements for Building Design and Construction. Similarly, 
UFC 3-201-01 and UFC 3-210-10 address the horizontal project aspects of vegetation design and 
stormwater control; these criteria collectively contribute to projects’ required adherence with the Guiding 
Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings. All qualifying USAF projects that meet the thresholds for 
required third-party certification as explained in UFC 1-200-02 are additionally required to pursue Guiding 
Principles certification through either the Green Building Initiative or the Green Business Certification Inc. 
programs. The requirements contained within this appendix do not interfere with a project’s ability to meet 
the minimum requirements of either the UFC or the third-party certification program; rather, the guidelines 
enhance projects’ resiliency and sustainability from a holistic approach and exceed nearly every minimum 
requirement for typical DoD projects. 

Within this section are requirements that apply to overall project design and do not necessarily lend 
themselves well to incorporation in individual Divisions. They represent holistic approaches rather than 
individual design components. Designers will see some specific mentions within other Divisions, however, 
when specific design features may be required that merit more detailed description in context of other 
products and materials. 

Integrative Process (Exceeds UFC 1-200-02) 

Integrative Process is a requirement of the Guiding Principles for vertical projects; this Tyndall AFB-
specific Appendix, however, requires the design strategy for all project types. 

04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

Review the Integrative Process (IP) ANSI Consensus National Standard Guide© 2.0 for Design and 
Construction of Sustainable Buildings and Communities, which provides step-by-step guidance and a 
methodology for improving building design, construction, and operations through a replicable, integrative 
process. Also review ASHRAE 189.1 Informative Appendix F (Integrated Design) in accordance with the 
requirements of UFC 1-200-02. 

Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to 
achieve synergies across disciplines and building systems. Use the analyses described below to inform 
the OPR, BOD, design documents, and construction documents. 

• 
Form a diverse team of qualified professionals as early as possible. 
– Team members must coordinate with one another throughout the life of the project. For optimal 
interaction and communication, ensure the project team has multiple face-to-face meetings. 
– The integrative Design Team should include, at minimum, the following roles: 
• 
Owner and/or client 
• 
Professionals knowledgeable in design, construction, and maintenance 
• 
Professionals knowledgeable in sustainable and resilient practices 
• 
Professionals with expertise in vegetation, water, soils, landscape ecology, materials, and 
human health and well-being, selected to meet the unique constraints and opportunities of 
the project and its site 
– Identify project stakeholders and full range of potential site user groups and list the primary and 
secondary user groups 
– All members of the project team must provide the following documentation: 
• 
Name of each team member and his or her expertise (for example, vegetation, hydrology, 
soil, landscape ecology, materials, and human health) 
• 
Role on the project 
• 
If an individual fulfills more than one role on the project, explain how he or she has the 
various skill sets or expertise for each 
• 
Develop a collaborative communication process: 
– Develop an agreed-upon communication method for team members, which should be 
collaborative and allow the viewpoints and perspectives of all members to be fully considered in 
the decision-making process 
– Designate a team facilitator to be responsible for overseeing and ensuring a collaborative 
communication process 
– Develop a narrative describing the collaborative communication process: 
• 
List of team members responsible for facilitating collaborative communication 
• 
Signatures from all team members who participated in the collaborative communication 
process 
• 
Attach meeting minutes from all team meetings 
• 
Identify project S+R principles and performance goals: 
– Identify the principles and performance goals of the project (both short-and long-term) and 
include an associated timeline and specific performance measures for each goal to determine 
when it has been achieved 
– Designate specific team members to track project goals throughout the development process: 
• 
Identify project stakeholders 
• 
Identify the full range of potential site users; list the primary and secondary user groups 
• 
Incorporate the S+R principles and performance goals into a program: 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

– Develop a program plan that at minimum includes the following information: 
• 
The unique characteristics, opportunities, and constraints of the site 
• 
General project parameters, such as the scope, budget, implementation schedule, purpose, 
and design intent of the project 
• 
A diagram or description of the intended function, arrangement, and relationship of desired 
features and their approximate dimensions 
– For all project types, perform a preliminary resiliency analysis before the completion of schematic 
design that identifies potential physical and procedural actions that can be taken by the project to 
prepare for and mitigate short-and long-term hazards to the building, occupants, physical 
property, and physical infrastructure. System diversity and redundancy should be considered and 
accounted for in the approach. There is preference for ecologically based resiliency approaches 
over a hardened infrastructure approach. Explore shock-resistant planning and design for 
extreme weather events/heat waves along with ongoing adaptation to increasing ambient 
temperatures, sea level rise and flood intensity, water security, energy security, transportation 
access, and local self-reliance. Planning and design interventions should result in complementary 
systems and technics that have low demands for and/or produce water and energy, while 
supporting biodiversity that offers stabilizing levels of redundancy/back-up, local/regional self-
reliance and development capacity, and shock resistance and recovery potential. 
• 
The study must consider damage impacts within the immediate project boundary and 
relevant surrounding areas along with the disruption of essential services that may become 
unavailable including, but not limited to electricity, water, sewer, security and fire department 
services. Opportunities for cooperative action with surrounding facilities or base-wide 
systems must be identified as a means of mitigation. Those opportunities will vary depending 
on the project location. 
• 
Safe and resilient issues reflecting site, local, regional hazards and opportunities may 
include, but are not limited to: extreme weather and rain, flooding, storm surge, extreme wind, 
discordant behavior or physical conflict, and exposure to hazardous materials. 
• 
For all projects: 
o 
Identify opportunities for cooperative behavior, collaboration and coordination to improve 
resilience and provide the socio-economic means for problem-solving. 
o 
Identify technical opportunities that can be used to improve resilience and provide 
physical tools for problem-solving. 
• 
Document how the above analysis informed design and form decisions in the project’s OPR 
and BOD and the eventual design of the project. 
– For all project types, perform a preliminary water budget analysis before the completion of 
schematic design that explores how to reduce potable water loads in the building and/or on the 
site, and accomplish related S+R goals. Assess and estimate the project’s potential non-potable 
water supply sources and water demand volumes, including the following: 
• 
Indoor water demand: assess flow and flush fixture design case demand volumes. 
• 
Outdoor water demand: assess landscape irrigation design case demand volume. 
• 
Process water demand: assess kitchen, laundry, cooling tower, and other equipment 
demand volumes, as applicable. 
• 
Supply sources: assess all potential non-potable water supply source volumes, such as 
onsite rainwater and graywater, municipally supplied nonpotable water, and HVAC equipment 
condensate. 
– Document how the above analysis informed building and site design decisions in the project’s 
OPR and BOD. Demonstrate how at least one onsite non-potable water supply source was used 
to reduce the burden on municipal supply or wastewater treatment systems by contributing to at 
least two of the water demand components listed above. Demonstrate how the analysis informed 
the design of the project, including the following, as applicable: 
04 October 2019

Plumbing systems 
• 
Sewage conveyance and/or onsite treatment systems 
• 
Rainwater quantity and quality management systems 
• 
Landscaping, irrigation, and site elements 
• 
Roofing systems and/or building form and geometry 
• 
Other systems 
– For buildings projects, perform a preliminary “simple box” energy modeling analysis before the 
completion of schematic design that explores how to reduce energy loads in the building and 
accomplish related S+R goals by questioning default assumptions. Assess at least two potential 
strategies associated with the following: 
• 
Site conditions: assess shading, exterior lighting, hardscape, landscaping, and adjacent site 
conditions 
• 
Massing and orientation: assess how massing and orientation affect HVAC sizing, energy 
consumption, lighting, and renewable energy opportunities 
• 
Basic envelope attributes: assess insulation values, window-to-wall ratios, glazing 
characteristics, shading, and window operability 
• 
Lighting levels: assess interior surface reflectance values and lighting levels in occupied 
spaces 
• 
Thermal comfort ranges: assess thermal comfort range options 
• 
Plug and process load needs: assess reducing plug and process loads through programmatic 
solutions (for example, equipment and purchasing policies, layout options) 
• 
Programmatic and operational parameters: assess multifunctioning spaces, operating 
schedules, space allotment per person, teleworking, reduction of building area, and 
anticipated O&M 
– Document how the above analysis informed design and building form decisions in the project’s 
OPR and BOD and the eventual design of the project, including the following, as applicable: 
• 
Building and site program 
• 
Building form and geometry 
• 
Building envelope and façade treatments on different orientations 
• 
Elimination and/or significant downsizing of building systems (for example, HVAC, lighting, 
controls, exterior materials, interior finishes, and functional program elements) 
• 
Other systems 
– Describe how all other S+R principles and performance goals will be incorporated into the design. 
– Engage the client in participating in and ideally leading a design charrette process with the 
assistance of the project Design Team leadership. The Design Team should embrace a systems 
thinking design approach. Follow the steps of design optimization, as applicable, in 
ASHRAE 189.1 Section F1.1.1 (Charrette Process). Maintain all meeting minutes as attachments 
for process documentation. 
• 
Plan for construction oversight: 
– Designate a team member, other than the contractor, who will be responsible for verifying the site 
is built per the construction specifications and drawings. 
– Meet with the contractor prior to construction to review construction specifications, submittal 
requirements, and drawings and to convey the project’s principles and performance goals. 
– Describe the agreed upon method whereby changes can be made in the field during construction. 
• 
Develop a strategy for preparing a site or project maintenance plan as appropriate: 
– Include all team members in the development of the maintenance plan. 
04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

– Discuss available resources (for example, budget, staff, volunteers, equipment, materials) as part 
of the maintenance plan. Determine short-and long-term maintenance principles and 
performance goals. 
• 
Compile all documentation required above as project record and submit in final electronic format to 
the Tyndall AFB project manager as part of the design closeout phase. 
General Design Requirements 

Accessible, Inclusive, Universal Design (Exceeds UFC 1-200-01) 

Universal design recognizes and encourages assets inclusive for all users regardless of age, size, ability, 
or disability to use an asset; it addresses multiple aspects of a built space, including infrastructure, 
signage, and technologies, and together seek to enhance the opportunity for all individuals to exist 
independently and comfortably in a space. Due to variations in legislation and design practices for 
accessibility, usability, and inclusivity, the project criterion herein does not stipulate extensive, specific 
design requirements, dimensions, or number of each type of feature within the asset. This criterion does, 
however, list strategies that Design Teams must consider for integration in order to constitute a 
reasonable level of provision and design of features for the type, size, and number of users of any 
particular asset. 

All projects must refer to the following best practice guidance as applicable to each project type: 

• 
ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction: Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment 
• 
BS 8300-1:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 1: External 
Environment: Code of Practice 
• 
BS 8300-2:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 2: Buildings: Code of 
Practice 
• 
Draft prEN 17210, Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, Functional Requirements 
• 
Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach, Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, 2012 
(http://universaldesign.ie/Built-Environment/Building-for-Everyone/) 
The following features must be integrated to the maximum extent possible as appropriate to each project 
type after projects have met required minimum project criteria: 

• 
Accessibility features related to access: 
– Step-free external access (that is, level, gentle slope, or ramp) from the site boundary to the main 
entrance(s) or alternative accessible entrance of the asset. 
– Handrails to external stepped and ramped access routes to the main entrance(s) or alternative 
accessible entrance of the asset. 
– Where car parking is provided for the asset and asset users include parents with young children, 
designated parking spaces for motorists accompanied by a child in a stroller 
• 
Accessibility features related to horizontal and vertical circulation: 
– Accessible horizontal and vertical emergency evacuation routes (such as in the event of fire) and 
facilities (such as evacuation chairs) or a strategy and plan for assisted evacuation. 
– Include resting areas with seating at various heights, including seating with back rests and 
without arm rests 
– Provide accessible routes 43 inches in width, at minimum 
– Install drinking fountains, assistance animal areas, and bike racks that are easily accessed from 
all sides 
– Include detectable warnings (such as truncated domes) at official pedestrian crossings that 
intersect with vehicular paths 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

– Design the site with open sight lines to and from entries 
• 
Accessibility features related to the use of a facility: 
– Power-operated entrance door(s) (such as via push pad or motion sensor). 
– Door and drawer hardware that requires no grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. 
– Install 36-inch wide doors, at minimum, in all occupied spaces 
– Provide circulation paths 20% wider than required, at minimum 
– Increase clear floor space at appliances and fixtures to 30 by 52 inches, at minimum 
– Increase the size of turning space to 72 inches in diameter, at minimum 
• 
Accessibility features related to sanitary accommodation: 
– Restroom(s) with an assistance alarm accessible by those who use wheelchairs, at least one of 
which is a gender-neutral facility. 
– Where asset users include parents with young children, baby changing facilities as well as baby 
strap-in chairs accessible for all parents regardless of gender. Include family restrooms. 
– Where showers, bathrooms, or changing rooms are provided for asset users, accessible versions 
to accommodate persons who use wheelchairs, persons with limited mobility, and similar. 
• 
Orientation and wayfinding: 
– Well-planned layouts that clearly identify key elements such as entrances, reception areas, 
sanitary facilities, and similar. 
– Good lighting conditions with additional illumination at decision points such as access routes, 
entrances, staircases, and elevators. 
– Clear information and legible and easily understood signage, including availability in different 
languages where appropriate to the asset location. 
– Use of visual contrast and color to facilitate orientation and navigation, to provide warnings about 
potential hazards, and to facilitate reading of information and signs. 
– Provision of tactile information, for example, embossed signage, Braille signage, tactile walking 
surface indicators, tactile maps, models and plans, changes in floor surface, changes in level, 
tapping rails. 
– Audible communication and sounds, for example, talking signs, announcement systems, audio 
descriptive way-finding information, changes in walking surface. 
• 
Assistive technologies: 
– Hearing enhancement system(s) (such as induction loop) at service or reception counters and in 
rooms and spaces used for meetings, lectures, classes, performances, spectator sport or films. 
– Audible information systems. 
– Visual alarm systems. 
– Height adjustable desks, adjustable height counters (with fixtures, where applicable), and 
accessible height sales and service counters. 
– Voice or touch screen operated controls for devices and systems affecting occupancy of the 
space and user comfort, including but not limited to, lighting, window shades, and thermostats. 
Through thoughtful incorporation of accessible and universal design, projects can establish an inclusive 
and enabling community where people of all abilities can effectively and easily access, use, and engage 
with a space. 

Adaptability and Flexible Design of Buildings 

Flexible design is a priority in military facilities, as mission priorities can shift and require different 
functionality needs. Having adaptable major building elements increases project space flexibility, ease of 

04 October 2019 


DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

adaptive use, and recycling of building materials while considering differential durability and premature 
obsolescence over building design life and individual component service lives. 

All vertical projects must produce a project-specific Functional Adaptation Study in early design phases, 
prior to the completion of concept development. The study must explore design strategies that could be 
used to ensure longevity of the building past initial intended use and occupancy type. Renovation projects 
must incorporate strategies as applicable to the existing site or building constraints. 

The functional adaptation strategy study must include exploration of the following: 

• 
Feasibility: The likelihood to contain multiple or alternative building uses, area functions and different 
tenancies over the expected life cycle, for example, related to the structural design of the building. 
• 
Accessibility: Design aspects that facilitate the replacement of all major components within the life of 
the building, for example, panels in floors and walls that can be removed without affecting the 
structure, providing lifting beams and hoists. Accessibility also involves access to local services, such 
as local power, data infrastructure, and similar. 
• 
Versatility: The degree of adaptability of the internal environment to accommodate changes in 
working practices. 
• 
Adaptability: The potential of the building ventilation strategy to adapt to future building occupant 
needs and climatic scenarios. 
• 
Convertibility: The degree of adaptability of the internal physical space and external shell to 
accommodate changes in use. 
• 
Expandability: The potential for the building to be extended, horizontally, or vertically. 
• 
Refurbishment Potential: The potential for major refurbishment, including replacing the façade. 
Project design must then be informed via the study results and must implement the strategies below to 
the maximum extent possible. New construction projects must include a minimum of six of the following 
flexible design strategies; renovation projects must include a minimum of three: 

• 
A flexible internal vertical loadbearing structure design with a regular column layout and few or no 
loadbearing walls. 
• 
Floor plan shapes, primary circulation routes, and floor-to-floor heights suitable for several potential 
future uses. 
• 
Use interstitial space. Design distribution zone utility systems and equipment (including HVAC, 
plumbing, electrical, information technology, and life safety systems) to serve the occupied zones and 
have the capacity to control multiple zones in both occupied and unoccupied spaces. 
• 
Implement flexible power distribution (that is, plug-and-play) systems for at least 50% of the project 
floor area so lighting, data, voice, and other systems can be easily reconfigured and repurposed. 
• 
Implement a flexible lighting control system with plug-and-play components such as wall controls, 
sensors, and dimming ballasts for a minimum of 50% of the lighting load. The system must allow for 
reconfiguring and repurposing of luminaires and controls without rewiring (such as having the 
capability to group and assign luminaires into zones and change those zones as needed). Also, the 
system must be flexible so that as a space changes functions, the lighting levels can change to suit 
the needs of the space without rewiring or removing or adding luminaires. 
• 
Identify horizontal expansion capacity equal to at least 30% of existing floor area without demolition of 
occupied space (other than at the connection point). 
• 
Design for future vertical expansion on at least 75% of the roof, ensuring that existing operations and 
service systems can continue at or near capacity during the expansion. 
• 
Design at least 50% of interior nonstructural walls, ceilings, and floors to be movable or demountable. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

• 
Use movable or modular casework for at least 50% of casework and custom millwork. Base the 
calculation on the combined value of casework and millwork, as determined by the cost estimator or 
contractor. 
• 
Include in at least one major component or systems purchase contract a clause specifying subcontractor, 
vendor, or onsite take back system. To meet the criteria for a take-back or leasing 
program, the arrangement must cover a “major system or component,” defined as any product or 
group of items used in the majority (more than 50%) of the project spaces where that item is relevant. 
Examples of qualifying systems include ceilings, carpeting, furniture, partitions, and casework. An 
example that may not qualify is built-in casework, which is typically not installed in more than half of a 
project’s spaces. 
• 
Include integral labels. Reuse and recycling extend the use of materials, but during deconstruction it 
can be difficult to identify reusable and recyclable products. Specifying products with integral labels 
(radio frequency identification, engraving, embossing, or other permanent marking) containing 
information on material origin, properties, and date of manufacture will allow easier identification and 
reuse of these materials in the future. Refer to the CSA Z782-06 Guideline for Design for 
Disassembly and Adaptability in Buildings for further information on integral labeling. 
• 
Leverage leasing arrangements. Systems such as furniture can be leased, and the vendor takes the 
items back when the contract is up or the furniture is no longer needed. Leasing systems increase the 
likelihood that items will be used more than once before they reach their end of life. They also remove 
the burden of disposal from the project and can create an incentive to provide durable, reusable, and 
recyclable products. 
• 
Other design features deemed suitable by the Tyndall AFB project manager. 
The Design Team must ensure, via coordination between their S+R Coordinator and that of the 
construction team, that performance is tracked through construction to ensure that the reuse and flexibility 
requirements specified in the project documents are implemented. 

The following documentation must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager in accordance with 
the above requirements: 

• 
A copy of the study 
• 
A narrative indicating which strategies will be implemented in the project, and justification of why 
remaining strategies were not employed. 
• 
Drawings indicating locations of interior elements 
• 
Tracking table showing total area of all interior elements, reused interior elements, percentage of 
reused elements, and cost of each element 
• 
Tracking table for furniture and furnishings, listing all items and showing total cost, costs for reused, 
salvaged, and refurbished items, and percentage of reused, salvaged, and refurbished items 
• 
Site drawings, floor plans, and sections (as applicable) showing compliance with flexibility strategies 
• 
Cutsheets and product information showing compliance with flexibility strategies (as applicable) 
01 89 26 Site Electrical Utilities Performance Requirements 

The Utilities Operations Center (UOC) and emergency generators must be designed in conformance to 
UFC 3-301-01, Structural Engineering, and the program wind speed requirements (USAF, 2019a) used in 
the structural design for DoD locations and implements the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 
Standard 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.

The success of Tyndall AFB is predicated on efficient facilities; reliable infrastructure; a safe work 
environment for the airmen, support staff, and visitors; and relevant work environments across strategic 
domains and performance dimensions. 

Given the increasing complexity and interdependency of building systems, a deficiency in any one system 
can have a significant impact to the overall operation and performance of other facilities. The operational 
team needs to be completely trained for all building systems functionality at the component and system 
levels. It is critical to the mission of the base that a process for seamlessly transitioning capital projects 
from construction to full operational control is implemented. 

Assurances can be provided by integrating a whole building commissioning program into each new 
construction and renovation project. The program extends from planning/1391 development through 
activation and occupancy. The following represent sections describe key elements of the program. 

Planning and Design Phase 

• 
Develop OPR: Includes the overall goals of the project; quality standards; operational and warranty 
requirements; training expectations (BOD, equipment level, and system level); cost considerations; 
and measurable performance criteria. 
• 
Develop BOD: Describes how each element of the OPR will be implemented in the design. 
• 
Participate in Focused Design Review: Determines if there are systematic errors and to ensure 
that training and warranty requirements meet our expectations, not to fully check the design accuracy 
of the Design Team. 
• 
Develop Commissioning (Cx) Specification: Defines the administrative requirements of the 
Commissioning Process and the Commissioning Authority (CxA) involvement with the contractor and 
is typically included in the General Conditions. 
• 
Develop the Cx Plan: Describes responsibilities of the Commissioning Team members, schedule, 
and activities through each phase of the project delivery, documentation requirements, 
communication channels, and procedures for documenting and resolving situations when verification 
does not meet the Owner's Project Requirements. 
• 
Develop the Measurement and Verification (M&V) Plan: Defines the method for evaluating and 
tracking the building energy performance. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

Construction Phase 

• 
Cx Site Observation During Rough-in: During the construction phase, especially when building 
systems are being installed, it is important for key members of the commissioning team to have a 
regular onsite presence. 
• 
O&M Documentation Cx Review: The coordination of O&M documentation is often left to the end of 
the project and can have a negative impact on how the systems operate over the life of the building. 
Early review of these documents results in improved quality and useful tools. 
• 
Warranty Documentation Cx Review: Given the importance of proper system operation over the life 
of the buildings, ensuring that equipment warranties meet the O&M team’s requirements is of critical 
importance. 
• 
Enterprise Asset Management System (EAMS)/Computerized Maintenance ManagementSystem (CMMS) Integration: The commissioning process should verify that all assets are fully 
integrated into the EAMS/CMMS. This process includes: 
– Verify the asset tagging information to confirm that the EAMS/CMMS tag aligns with all other 
documentation associated with a particular asset. Ideally, the naming protocol is established early 
in the project so that it can be carried forward throughout the design and construction process. 
– Observe actual asset tag locations and content while onsite is beneficial to confirm consistency. 
– Ensue the maintenance practices incorporated in the EAMS/CMMS represent industry best 
practices for that particular asset and not just boilerplate O&M data. 
– Verify warranty information is properly captured in the EAMS/CMMS can prevent unintentional 
repairs on equipment that is under warranty. 
• 
Pre-Functional Testing: Pre-functional checklists (PFCs) are used to ensure the equipment and 
systems are installed and operational in accordance with the contract documents and that Functional 
Performance Testing (FPT) may proceed without unnecessary delays. The Cx team prepares the 
PFCs that address asset labeling, equipment delivery, installation, start-up, and building automation 
system configuration for all systems and equipment being commissioned. 
• 
Equipment Start-up: Is the first chance to observe the equipment in its operating condition and is an 
essential part of the Cx process. 
• 
Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing (TAB) Review: TAB is a critical element of the project delivery 
process. The CxA should work with construction team to coordinate their activities of the TAB 
contractor for each project. 
• 
Training Planning: As part of the training planning process, the training requirements should be 
reviewed against the expectations and requirements of the O&M team. 
Testing and Training 

• 
Attend Planning Meetings: The Cx team schedules, organizes, leads, and supervises the functional 
performance testing, with the involvement of the installing contractors to operate systems. 
• 
Functional Performance Testing: This is the dynamic testing of systems under full operation. 
– An FPT only commences when the pre-functional testing and checklists are complete and 
approved by the CxA and O&M team. 
– Systems are tested under various modes (such as during low loads, high loads, component 
failures, unoccupied, varying outdoor conditions, alarm conditions, and utility failures). The 
systems are run through all the Energy Management Control System (EMCS)sequences of 
operation and components are verified to be responding as intended. When systems do not pass 
a test, issues are clearly documented in an issues log. Items in the log are reviewed and closed 
through the issue resolution process. Systems are then re-tested. 
– The results of this phase establish the operational baseline for the systems and their 
components. The O&M team time commitment can be significant, particularly for a large project.

O&M team participation during FPT is possibly the best method of introducing building systems to 
those responsible for operating them. Systems to be commissioned include: 

• 
Mechanical 
• 
Electrical 
• 
Plumbing 
• 
Life safety (Fire Protection and Fire Alarm System) 
• 
Energy Management and Control Systems 
• 
Building Envelope 
• 
Low voltage 
o 
Security 
o 
Mass notification 
o 
Distributed Antennae 
o 
Synchronized Clock System 
• 
Conveyance/vertical transportation 
• 
Integrated Systems Testing (IST): The building systems’ interoperability is verified under a number 
of failure scenarios. In critical facilities, this is an industry standard best Cx practice. The primary test 
is when the normal power supply to the building is “turned off” and the team observes how the 
building systems respond. During this test, not only are generators, fuel systems, and transfer 
switching tested, but many other integrated systems are verified for performance under these 
conditions. While on normal power and emergency power, the team needs to verify that the EMCS, 
fire alarm, security, and other systems continue to operate as designed regardless of power source or 
power switching. It is common to find some systems do not perform correctly when switching to 
emergency power or back to normal power. The IST process is the first time the O&M team will be 
exposed to emergency management procedures related to the new facility and the lessons learned 
are extremely valuable. The results of this testing often drives institutional standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) and utility management plans. 
• 
Corrective Action: Corrective Issue Reports (CIRs) are generated by the CxA when issues or 
problems arise during the Cx process. The report will describe the problem condition along with any 
related reference information and issued to the construction team for corrective action. When the 
necessary corrections have been completed, the actions taken are documented and the item is 
closed in the issues log. Depending on the nature of the issue or problem, the CxA, along with the 
project stakeholders, will determine if re-testing of the equipment or system is necessary. It is 
important to have the O&M team engaged during the corrective issues process so the issue is clearly 
understood by all parties and everyone understands the resolution. 
• 
Owner Training: Training is one of the most important aspects of turning the project over to the O&M 
team. As-built documents, O&M manuals, and all approved submittals should be turned over to the 
O&M staff prior to any training. The delivery of close-out materials should be verified by the CxA. The 
training must include both component/equipment level and integrated system level sessions. All 
training sessions should follow the pre-approved agendas and plans, all attendees should sign the 
attendance sheet during the sessions, and a follow-up evaluation is performed to verify the trainees 
were provided with the pertinent information to properly operate and maintain the facility. All training 
materials should be captured and translated into a format, such as PowerPoint, that allows for new 
hire training as well as continuous training of current staff. Training sessions are only effective if 
attended by the appropriate personnel. At this point in the transition to operational control, there 
should be representation from each responsible shift attending the training sessions for each building 
system. This is another critical step in the delivery process. 
Post Construction 

• 
Finalize SOPs: One of the keys to achieving operational excellence is having clear, concise 
documentation on how the integrated building systems function as a whole. As part of the systems 
manual, SOPs for all potential conditions should be provided. These should be developed to allow for 
the documents to be laminated and placed on or near the primary system components and control 
points. In a “critical to mission” environment, being able to respond to an unplanned incident quickly 
and effectively can have a direct impact on mission readiness and being prepared for such an event 
is the best way to mitigate that risk. During the development of the standard operating procedures, 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01 

the Cx/O&M team plays a vital role where they need to define their team composition and provide 
input to the level of detail desired for each system. 

• 
Seasonal/Deferred Testing: Despite all the efforts of the Cx team members to complete all 
verification testing prior to project close-out and occupancy, identify any systems that cannot be 
tested at this juncture because of project phasing and/or weather conditions. Any seasonal 
verification issues will be well documented and the appropriate Cx team members will need to be 
convened to carry out these tests. The need for O&M team involvement is crucial because the facility 
is now occupied and under their control. These tests will need to be closely coordinated to ensure 
occupant comfort and overall life safety is not impacted. 
• 
Warranty Item Review and Verification: Ideally, 10 months into the 12-month warranty period the 
team returns to meet with the specific O&M personnel. This process should include and be recorded 
in the Final Cx Report: 
– Review of O&M experience in operating various systems 
– Recommendations for improvement 
– Warranty claims registered during the first months of operation 
– Record documentation of any warranty items that require follow-up 
– Summary of O&M personnel recommendations for system performance enhancements 
– O&M staff requests for additional and/or supplementary training sessions 
– Suggestions for improvements in the Cx process to be implemented on future projects 
• 
M&V Implementation: To ensure that energy performance goals are achieved, incorporating 
measurement and verification elements into the project delivery process is essential. Even though the 
facilities will be brand new, the design phase began several years ago and there may be 
opportunities for further energy consumption savings. Throughout construction, the team may identify 
additional measures that should be considered for future savings. 
– M&V should be implemented during the warranty phase and after a full year of occupancy. 
– The energy performance of the facilities should be observed and the performance documented. 
Since full occupancy may be well beyond the initial warranty period, the operational team should 
review the performance after a full year of occupancy to verify that the true targeted goals are 
being achieved and to identify any additional measures that may be implemented. 
• 
Final EMCS Training: Final training on EMCS needs to occur within the first month of occupancy. 
Several training sessions prior to occupancy will help the O&M staff establish baseline knowledge. 
The final training will focus on system level operations within the occupied facility. 
• 
Long-term Training: A long-term training planning should address core competency requirements 
that align with the building systems in place. With an ongoing training plan in place, the O&M team 
will be able to operate the facilities safely, efficiently, and effectively under all operating conditions. 
• 
Develop Monitoring Based Cx Program: A continuous process to resolve operating issues, 
improve comfort, and optimize energy use. Using the successfully commissioned systems as the 
baseline, all the operating parameters and sequences of operation are recorded. Through the EMCS, 
“trigger” points are identified, and alarms are initiated when a system is performing out of its 
optimized range. These points can include efficiency rating (kilowatts per ton [kW/ton]), a setpoint 
(static pressure), or total runtime (hours) – individually or in a combination. Monthly reports should be 
generated that allow the O&M team to search for anomalies. This process verifies that the building 
and systems performance are optimized to meet the current operating requirements, which ultimately 
extends the useful life of an asset and reduces the operating costs. 
The following General Cx specification section describes the process and contractor requirements:

1.2. SUMMARY 
A. The purpose of the Cx Process is to provide the Owner with independent verification that the 
systems to be commissioned have been constructed according to the contract documents and 
operate within the performance guidelines set forth in the OPR, the BOD, the project construction 
drawings, and specifications. Commissioning consists of systematically documenting that 
specified components and systems have been installed and activated properly and then 
functionally tested to verify and document proper operation through all sequences of operation 
and conditions. In addition, training of the Owner’s O&M personnel will be verified, and final 
project O&M documents will be reviewed for completeness and to support the successful 
transition from construction phase to the occupancy and use phase. 
B. The commissioning process does not alleviate or reduce the responsibility of the design 
professionals, construction managers, or installing contractors to provide a complete and finished 
product, installed and fully functional in accordance with the contract documents. 
C. Commissioning is intended to enhance the quality of system start-up and aid in the orderly 
transfer of systems for use and maintenance by the Owner. Quality Cx requires participation by 
all parties involved with the project design and construction process, including the Owner, Design 
Team, construction managers and contractors, and the Owner’s Facilities Management. 
D. The Commissioning Authority will lead the Cx team, planning and coordinating all commissioning 
activities in conjunction with Cx team members.

C. The CxA will review the proposed training information with the Owner. If the submitted information 
is complete, the CxA will respond to the contractor to proceed with scheduling the subject training 
session. 
D. A summary list of all anticipated training exercises to be provided is to be submitted for review by 
the contractor and updated throughout the project as required. Initial submittal should be made no 
later than the mid-point of construction, well in advance of any system turnover / training 
activities. All systems, sub-systems and equipment packages that will have manufacturer, vendor, 
or contractor demonstration or training exercises are to be listed with anticipated dates and 
duration. These events will be tracked and updated by the CxA and reported to the 
Commissioning Team when executed.

PROTECTION 

All manufactured products falling under this category must have a current Miami-Dade NOA that 
demonstrates compliance with the wind pressures determined from the wind speed (USAF, 2019a) 
above. 

This section describes materials required to be used as vapor barriers, exterior finishes, weather barriers, 
roof covers, air barriers, and thermal insulation (building insulation) to prevent unwanted exterior weather-
related elements from entering the building. 

A building’s exterior thermal and moisture barrier envelope must have an insulation system with an 
R-value to meet the appropriate code-required criteria and meet the designed energy use goals of 
the facility. 

Avoid use of insulation that, if exposed to water infiltration, can retain water. All metal to be used on the 
exterior facade must meet the manufacturers finish requirements for coastal environment for warranties. 

07 20 00 THERMAL PROTECTION 

07 21 00 Thermal Insulation 

Exterior wall systems must only use polyiso or high density closed cell foam. 

Outboard insulation (the “perfect” wall) must have vapor retarders. 

Air and water infiltration standards must be met for all envelope barrier assemblies. 

Consider installing radiant barriers with manufacturer’s perforated option directly at the inside face of the 
roof deck to reduce cooling loads and to ensure proper passage of moisture through the radiant barrier. 
Do not install radiant barriers in such a way that they create a secondary vapor barrier. 

07 22 00 Roof and Deck Insulation 

Insulate concrete roof slabs and ceilings or attics to improve thermal performance and occupant comfort. 
Consider low-emission (formaldehydes), high recycled content, non-ozone-depleting insulation materials. 

For roof insulation, provide polyisocyanurate board that is in accordance with ASTM C1289 REV A, 
except that the minimum compressive strength must be 20 pounds per square inch (psi) (140 kilopascals) 
(Type I, foil faced on both sides). 

Use closed-cell rigid polyisocyanurate board insulation for the roof and deck insulation and create 
outboard insulation systems that provide the “perfect” thermal and moisture barrier condition with the use 
of vapor retarders. 

Use glass mat gypsum roof board for the underlayment and cover board that adheres to ASTM 
C1177/C1177M, 0 Flame Spread and 0 Smoke Developed when tested in accordance with ASTM E84, 
500 psi, Class A, non-combustible, 5/8 inch thick, 4 by 8 feet . 

Fasten insulation to resist uplift pressure at the corners, perimeter, and field of the roof to meet the wind 
requirements stated herein..

IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 07 

Install cover boards over insulation so the long joints are in continuous straight lines with end joints 
staggered between the rows. Loosely butt the cover boards together and fasten to roof deck to resist the 
wind load requirements. 

07 26 00 Vapor Retarders 

Incorporate vapor retarders at exterior wall and roofing assemblies on the humid moisture-laden warm 
side of the wall or roof to restrict moisture from entering the facility envelope. 

• 
Polyethylene sheeting, Class 1 with a permeance of less than 0.1 perms, ASTM E 1745, joints taped 
• 
A below-slab vapor barrier having a permeance rating below 0.01 perms 
Provide vapor barriers under and around slab-on-grade foundations and footings to prevent moisture 
vapor from rising up from the subgrade through the concrete and entering into interior spaces. 

Moisture entering the building as well as wall and roof construction cavities can lead to moisture problems 
when trapped moisture cannot escape, mold forms, and building materials become damaged. 

07 27 00 Air Barriers 

Air barrier performance is critical to energy performance and building durability because leaking 
assemblies allow moist air to penetrate the building, which wastes energy, causes mold, damages 
building components, and causes discomfort to those inside. 

Air barriers must be continuous across the entire building envelope, including continuity among floors, 
walls, and roof assemblies. 

Air barrier performance must be tested in accordance with ASTM E779, and the infiltration must not 
exceed 0.15 cfm/ft2 of envelope at 75 Pa. 

Provide materials in the following categories as used in the air barrier system or assembly of the exterior 
wall system are tested and are required to conform to ASTM E2178: 

• 
Self-adhered sheet membranes 
• 
Fluid applied membranes 
• 
Spray polyurethane foam 
• 
Accessory products 
A construction mock-up must be provided. 

Fasten the thermal barrier to the roof deck as required to resist the wind design standard uplift forces with 
corrosion-resistant fasteners. 

07 30 00 STEEP SLOPE ROOFING 

Roofs must be designed to be waterproof, drain quickly, be long-lasting, resilient to the Florida sun, easy 
to flash penetrations through, and easy to maintain. Roofs designed to drain with excessive penetrations 
and complex configurations are known in the industry as being difficult to flash and waterproof. 
Overhangs extensions are acceptable but must provide protection of walls and fenestration below, but not 
so wide they will be affected and damaged by high hurricane winds. 

04 October 2019 


DIVISION 07 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

Steep-sloped roof designs are preferred to low-slope roofs wherever possible because of the area’s high 
rainfall. Steep-sloped roofing systems must be constructed with a minimum slope of 4:12 unless 
otherwise required by functional criteria. Sloped roofs may have various geometries. Gable or hip-style 
roofs best. A hip-style roof design is preferred because it has proven resistance to wind uplift forces. 
Severely steep sloped roofs of greater than 5:12 pitch should be avoided because they can become 
“sails” that catch more wind and are subject to both higher uplift and overturning forces. 

07 40 00 ROOFING AND SIDING PANELS 

Both the fascia and soffit must be of the same material as the roofing. Vents and piping that must 
penetrate a roof must be treated as trim material and painted to match the roof. If possible, such elements 
should be located on areas out of view. 

Material must be aluminum. 

07 41 00 Roof Panels 

Furnish the metal roof panel manufacturer’s minimum 20-year no-dollar-limit roof system materials and 
installation workmanship warranty, including flashing, components, trim, and accessories necessary for 
watertight roof system construction. The warranty must be made directly to the Government, commencing 
at time of Government’s acceptance of the roof work. 

Do not use less than 18-gauge (1.27 millimeter [mm]). Use roll-form aluminum roof panels. The profile 
must be a 2-1/2-inch-high standing seam that includes mechanical crimping with concealed clips and 
fasteners. 

07 41 10 Attachment Clips 

Provide or fabricate stainless-steel clips. Size, shape, thickness, and capacity must meet the specified 
insulation thickness and design load criteria. 

07 42 00 Wall Panels 

Insulated metal wall panels must be of a thickness to satisfy energy codes and energy conservation 
goals. Use 24-gauge aluminum metal skins with rigid insulation cores, lap seams, flat, and embossed with 
light texture. 

Insulated metal wall panels may be used if they are watertight, installed watertight, and are of the 
interlocking type to provide a continuous weather tight building envelope. 

All breakaway walls in all flood hazard areas must have flood openings. 

Uninsulated wall panels must be 18 gauge and similar to the roof panels. 

07 42 60 Foam-Insulation Core Wall Panel 

Provide factory-formed aluminum wall panel assembly fabricated from two sheets of metal with modified 
polyisocyanurate or polyurethane foam insulation core (foamed-in-place) during fabrication with joints 
between panels designed to form weather-tight seals. Include accessories required for weather-tight 
installation.

07 50 00 MEMBRANE ROOFING 

• 
Membrane roofing must be capable of at least 150% elongation, and recovery and must be adhered 
to the substrate. 
• 
The material selected must withstand ponding water, especially if the roof slope is less than 1/2 inch 
in 12 inches and if the coating is protecting topside insulation. 
• 
Heavy self-adhering or liquid applied self-sealing air or vapor barriers should be used. 
Due to concerns with heavy rains, heat, mold, and humidity requirements, fluid-applied silicone materials 
with non-woven polyester full fabric reinforcement and integrated mildewcide/anti-staining agents are the 
preferred fluid-applied roofing system, as it is durable, self-cleaning, and has multiple color selections. 
Other fluid-applied roofing systems, such as urethane or silicone-based coatings, can be considered if 
these systems include continuous full fabric non-woven polyester reinforcement. Elastomeric roof coating 
system with color other than white must be warrantied against excessive fading for 10 years. 

Roof-coating systems must provide a minimum 20-year warranty. 

To reduce heat island effect, use light-colored roofing materials that have a high solar reflectance, high-
infrared emittance, and good connective heat transfer. 

Provide roof coatings with low-VOC, recycled content, and bio-based content coatings, if appropriate, and 
in compliance with the criteria set forth in Division 01. 

For flat roofs, provide an 80-mil thermoplastic polyolefin roofing membrane that is fully adhered .is 
preferred 

Flexible walkways must have factory-formed, nonporous, heavy-duty, solid-rubber, slip-resisting, surface-
textured walkway pads, approximately 3/16-inch (5-mm) thick, and acceptable to the membrane roofing 
system manufacturer. 

07 60 00 FLASHING AND SHEET METAL 

Flashing and sheet metal are necessary materials to provide building envelope closure and resilience to 
weather (close gaps and prevent the weather from penetrating the building envelope). 

07 62 00 Sheet Metal Flashing and Trim 

Long-lasting flashings, to include copper and stainless steel, should be specified. Flashings must be 
resistant to decay from salts. If using anodized, provide an additional coating for coastal environments as 
required by the manufacturer.

DIVISION 07 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

07 70 00 ROOF AND WALL SPECIALTIES AND ACCESSORIES 

07 71 00 Roof Specialties 

Roof specialties such as soffit vents, eave vents, membrane vents, premanufactured roof penetrations 
are required to facilitate that all roof cover penetrations are made watertight, resilient to the weather and 
seal out water infiltration. 

Penetrations such as vents, roof hatches, skylights, and similar must not be installed in roofs of new 
facilities due to previous historical damage from hurricanes which incurred costly water damage. 
Eliminate these and similar items unless required by other criteria. 

Roof parapets are not to be used to the maximum extent possible because heavy rainfall and hurricane-
generated windborne flying debris may collect behind these walls and restrict runoff, which could lead to 
structural failure. Where facility design warrants roof parapets, the Designer of Record (DOR) must 
provide an appropriately designed roof drainage system that will include drain overflows. Roof drain 
overflows must be located at all roof drain locations and must be minimum of 4 inches high by 
12 inches wide. 

07 72 00 Roof Accessories 

Roof-mounted equipment and roof penetrations have historically caused or contributed to costly hurricane 
damage. Eliminate these and similar items unless required by other criteria. 

Design the facility to eliminate roof openings: 

• 
Incorporate wall fenestrations (windows, light shelves, clerestories with hurricane-rated glazing 
blocks). Do not use skylights. Skylight applications are not desirable and must require a waiver from 
the base Architect. 
• 
When practical, locate solar water panels, photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines other electrical 
equipment, and mechanical equipment at ground level. Fully adhered building-integrated PV systems 
must be considered. 
• 
Do not use interior ladders to access roof hatches. Incorporate wall-mounted exterior ladders 
complying with antiterrorism/force protection (ATFP) requirements (lockable access, located within a 
controlled area). 
Downspouts are to be prefinished to match the background color against which they are viewed. This 
often results in the downspout being painted more than a single color. 

All rooftop elements on sloped standing-seam metal roofs that can be viewed must be prefinished to 
match the roof color. 

Internal roof drains are discouraged. 

07 77 00 Wall Specialties 

Textured Acrylic Finish System is acceptable for high-impact environments. 

Use of glass fiber reinforcing mesh in the base coats is recommended: 

• 
Back wrap the entire perimeter. 
• 
Use standard-impact reinforcing mesh that is not less than 4.0 ounces per square yard. 
• 
For picture-frame and butterfly corners use, reinforcing mesh not less than 9.5 ounces per 
square yard.

07 90 00 JOINT PROTECTION 

Preconstruction Compatibility and Adhesion Testing 

Submit to the joint-sealant manufacturers eight samples of materials that will contact or affect joint 
sealants. Use the manufacturer's standard test method to determine whether priming and other specific 
joint preparation techniques are required to obtain rapid, optimum adhesion of joint sealants to joint 
substrates. 

Preconstruction Field-Adhesion Testing 

Before installing sealants, field test their adhesion to the project’s joint substrates. Test the joint sealants 
according to Method A, Field-Applied Sealant Joint Hand Pull Tab, in Appendix X1 in ASTM C 1193 or 
Method A, Tail Procedure, in ASTM C 1521. 

07 92 00 Joint Sealants 

Joint sealants are used to prevent water from penetrating into the building through the building joints. All 
penetrations and building envelope penetrations where two or more materials are located next to one 
another have a space between them. Installing sealant in the joint will stop blowing water from 
penetrating into the building envelope, thus adding another layer of resiliency to the building 
envelope design. 

• 
Provide sealant materials selected for compatibility with each other and with substrates in each joint 
system. Confirm compatibility and application with the sealant material manufacturer to confirm the 
proper type of sealant and installation. 
• 
Provide elastomeric sealants that comply with ASTM C 920 for joints between aluminum storefront 
and adjacent substrates, tilt-up panels, floor joints, and around plumbing fixtures.

• 
Provide latex sealant that complies with ASTM C 834 for interior use at doors and windows. 
• 
Provide silicone sealant that complies with ASTM C 920 for exterior sealant for use in curtain walls. 
Floor Joint Sealer 

• 
The joint filler may separate from the edges when placed before the concrete is finished shrinking or if 
temperature inside the building has too great of a variance. 
• 
The joint filler must be replaced after the floor stops its movement. This should be considered a part 
of the Owner’s maintenance. 
All concrete horizontal and vertical construction joints (concrete, precast concrete, tilt up concrete) must 
have a concrete step detail that prevents water from being driven directly through the joint. 

All concrete vertical joints must have a lapped or keyed detail that prevents water from being driven 
directly through the joint. All joints must be properly prepared and sealed. 

Sealants must be applied to joints that incorporate step, lap, or key joints to further provide a positive 
weather seal. Sealant joint design, priming, tooling, masking, cleaning, and application must be in 
accordance with the general requirements of Sealants: A Professionals’ Guide from the Sealant, 
Waterproofing & Restoration Institute (2013). All sealants must conform to ASTM C 920. 

Joints must include proper backing material for sealant support during application, control of sealant 
depth, and to act as a bond breaker. Use filler boards, backer rods, and bond breaker tapes. Confirm with 
the sealant manufacturer whether priming should be used. Applied sealant must be tooled. Tooling must 
not compact sealant less than the minimum sealant thickness required. Mask adjacent surfaces to control 
sealant boundaries during sealant application.

DIVISION 09 FINISHES 

Salt Spray Test: A sample of the sheets must withstand a salt spray test for a minimum of 1,000 hours in 
accordance with ASTM B177, including the scribe requirements in the test, the coating must contain 
blisters larger than No. 8 on no more than 20% of exposed area. 

Accelerated Weathering (chalking resistance and color change): A sample of the sheets must 
withstand a weathering test a minimum of 2,000 hours in accordance with ASTM G23, using a Type D 
apparatus, without cracking, peeling, blistering, loss of adhesion of the protective coating, or corrosion of 
the base metal. Protective coating that can be readily removed from the base metal with a pen-knife 
blade or similar instrument must be considered as an area indicating loss of adhesion. After the 
2,000-hour weatherometer test, exterior coating change must not exceed two National Bureau of 
Standard units in accordance with ASTM D2244. 

Humidity Test: When subjected to a humidity cabinet test in accordance with ASTM D 2247 for 
1,000 hours, a scored panel must show no signs of blistering, cracking, creepage, or corrosion. 

Abrasion-resistant Test: When subjected to the falling sand test in accordance with ASTM D968, the 
coating system must withstand a minimum of 30 liters of sand before the appearance of the base metal. 

09 00 00 FINISHES 

Use breathable, water-resistant, non-cellulose (no wood byproduct), and mildew-resistant interior finishes 
and materials. Use paperless (glass mat) gypsum board, fiberglass mesh tape, acrylic paints that breathe, 
ceramic coated wall board screws, galvanized G90 light-gauge framing, and non-cellulose spray on foam 
insulation where needed. 

Durability, maintenance, and cost-efficiency are primary considerations in choosing interior finishes. 
Neutral base colors with contrasting accented accessories should be applied when appropriate. Specialty 
areas may have specific requirements that need to be determined on an individual basis. The designer 
must consider the applicable UFC, building codes, fire ratings, acoustical performance, structural needs, 
and thermal and moisture transmission characteristics when designing project-specific interior 
assemblies. Where a conflict exists within this standard and other applicable codes or standards, the 
more stringent must apply. If a selected material subsequently proves to be unavailable during design or 
construction, samples of alternative materials must be submitted for approval, prior to placing orders. 

Permanent finishes are generally the hard surface structural interior design finishes that will last 15 to 
20 years and whose removal and re-installation is a major disruption to the facility. Such items as vinyl 
composition tile (VCT), ceramic and other surface tile, plastic laminates, toilet partitions, lockers, window 
blinds, all modular or systems furniture panels, work surfaces, flipper doors, and similar are considered 
permanent finishes. Generally permanent finishes need to be a color that will not become dated in a 
few years.

DIVISION 09 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

The bottom of the paperless gypsum board must be undercut 1/2 inch (13 mm) to prevent water wicking 
up during potential flooding. 

Imported board is not allowed. All wet areas subject to water build up, splashing, condensate, or tile 
require dense shield or cement board. Green board can be allowed when not subject to the preceding 
conditions. 

09 30 00 TILING 

All tile work must be performed only by companies that are members of the Tile Council of North America 
(TCNA) and must comply with the latest TCNA installation handbook. 

• 
Do not install porous surfaces in high-traffic areas. 
• 
Use lower absorption-level tiles to have a greater resistance against stains. 
• 
Install larger tiles, 12 inches by 12 inches, in high-traffic areas to minimize grout lines. 
Breaking Strength: In order to determine the strength and durability of ceramic tile, a standard test 
method (ASTM C648) is used to evaluate the tile. A force is applied to an unsupported portion of the tile 
specimen until breakage occurs. The ultimate breaking strength is then recorded in pounds. The ANSI 
standard requires an average breaking strength of 250 pounds for floor tile. 

Coefficient of Friction: This is a term used in physics to describe the amount of force required to cause 
an object to start moving across a surface. Tiles are tested for coefficient of friction in accordance with 
ASTM C-1028. A quantitative value can be determined to generally express the relative degree of slip 
resistance. A higher coefficient indicates increased resistance. Although there is no current ANSI 
requirement, a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.50 (wet and dry) is the recognized industry standard for 
a slip-resistant flooring surface. The OSHA also recommends this same standard for walking surfaces. 
The ADA recommends a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) for accessible routes and 

0.80 for ramps. 
Scratch Hardness (Mohs Hardness): The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that 
should be addressed when selecting tile. Scratch resistance of glazes is measured by scratching the 
surface of the tile with different minerals and assigning a “Mohs Scale Hardness” number to the glaze, the 
softest mineral used is talc (a rating of 1) and the hardest is a diamond (a rating of 10 if no scratch). Most 
glazes used on ceramic tile fall in the five to six range, which is also slightly harder than most steels. 
Case-hardened steel, such as what is used in drill bits, is approximately six and will scratch most glazes. 
Quartz, No. 7 on the Mohs scale, will scratch most glazes (sand is a common example of natural quartz). 

Tile is appropriate for all areas that may be subject to high foot traffic, wetness, and require the need for 
increased durability, for example, dining facilities, kitchens, break rooms, restrooms, entry lobbies, floors, 
walls, and similar. 

Technical Criteria: Select tile based on the performance criteria appropriate for the functional use of the 
space. There are five properties of ceramic tile to consider: coefficient of friction, durability classification or 
Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI), scratch hardness, breaking strength, and water absorption. 

Select tiles with the following properties: 

• 
Coefficient of Friction: Floor tile must have a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) or 
higher in accordance with ASTM C-1028. Standing water and other contaminants create slippery 
conditions for any hard surface floor material. Floor applications with exposure to these conditions 
require extra caution in the tile selection. Use abrasive grains or raised textured tile for greater 
traction in areas with the possibility of standing water or grease build up. 
• 
Durability Classification: Floor tile must be Class IV—Heavy Traffic, durability classification as rated 
by the manufacturer when tested in accordance with ASTM C-1027 for abrasion resistance as related 
to foot traffic. Class III can be considered for residential installations. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 09 

• 
Scratch Hardness: Glazed floor tile must have a scratch hardness of 6.0 or higher. Do not use 
glazed tile in areas of high abuse where possible tile breakage may occur. Avoid high gloss or 
polished tiles for areas with high traffic; use only as accents in floor patterns. 
• 
Breaking Strength: Tile must be impact-resistant with a minimum breaking strength of 250 pounds in 
accordance with ASTM C-648. 
• 
Water Absorption: Use only vitreous or impervious tile for most applications in accordance with 
ASTM C-373. 
Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The 
pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile. 
Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts. 

• 
Slip Resistance: This is a major factor in the selection of tiles for kitchens and entrance lobbies. 
There are numerous products that have slip-resisting features for lobbies. Unglazed quarry tile works 
best for commercial kitchen floor installations. Because of the possibility of water and grease spillage, 
unglazed tile must be sealed in kitchens. 
• 
Color: Recommend tile with through-color, that is, color the entire thickness of the tile body. Avoid 
solid color tiles unless designed into a pattern. Avoid light-colored quarry tile in commercial kitchens. 
Colors and patterns must be approved by the Government. 
• 
Texture: Tiles with a textured surface and an interesting variation of colors will tend to show less 
surface soiling. 
• 
Grout: Select medium to dark pigmented grouts. Light grouts tend to change color and trap soil over 
time. Minimize the visibility of grout by using larger-sized tile. 
• 
Base: Use a matching tile base in commercial kitchens and other areas subject to excessive water. In 
other locations, wood or vinyl base may be appropriate. Ensure that there is an aesthetical transition 
If possible, use a dark tone grout, which coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled 
appearance. 

09 50 00 CEILINGS 

09 53 00 Acoustical Ceiling Suspension Assemblies 

• 
Provide ceiling suspension that meets seismic requirements under the International Building Code. 
• 
Wire hangers, braces, and ties: Use zinc-coated carbon-steel; ASTM A 641, Class 1 zinc coating, soft 
temper. 
• 
Tiles must be snug to grid, and the grid must be square and level. Penetrations must be centered in 
tiles and the system must be centered within room. 
• 
Install hold-down clips were required. 
09 60 00 FLOORING 

Use products that are moisture and mold/mildew-resistant, such as hard tiles with breathable grout joints 
and breathable sealed concrete. Use only ceramic tile floor tiles, terrazzo, or other nonabsorbent floor 
finishes on first floors and slabs on grade especially at entrance areas where hurricane flooding 
can occur. 

Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The 
pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile. 
Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts.

Except where noted, all corridors, labs, and support areas must receive VCT. 

Welded seam rubber sheet flooring is an alternative to resilient flooring. Depending on chemical usage 
and traffic, welded seam rubber flooring with a minimum thickness of 3.0 mm, may be an acceptable 
alternative to VCT some laboratories, lab support areas, and equipment areas. 

Resilient Base and Accessories 

All VCT floors must have a 4-or 6-inch rubber base in color to match existing new base, be a minimum of 
1/8-inch thick, and in a color selected by the architect. All fixed casework must have a 4-inch rubber base. 
Prefabricated or formed corners should not be used. 

Performance Characteristics and Other Criteria 

• 
Provide resistant tile flooring per ASTM F 1066, Class 2 (through-pattern tile).

International Certified Flooring Installer Association or manufacturer approved installer. 

Provide low-VOC products for carpet, adhesives, sealants, and carpet cushions as set forth in the criteria 
outlined in Division 01. 

04 October 2019 


DIVISION 09 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

Environmental Limitations 

Do not install carpet until wet work in spaces is complete and dry, and ambient temperature and humidity 
conditions are maintained at the levels indicated for Project when occupied for its intended use. 

Bonded polyurethane carpet cushion must contain the highest practicable percentage of material that has 
been recovered or diverted from solid waste (for example, post-consumer waste), but not including 
material reused in a manufacturing process. Where two materials have comparable price and 
performance, the one having the higher recovered-material content must be selected. 

Concrete Subfloors 

Verify that concrete slabs comply with ASTM F 710 and the following: 

• 
Slab substrates are dry and free of curing compounds, sealers, hardeners, and other materials that 
may interfere with adhesive bond. 
• 
Determine adhesion and dryness characteristics by performing bond and moisture tests 
recommended by the following: 
– Carpet manufacturer. 
– Carpet cushion manufacturer. Subfloors are free of cracks, ridges, depressions, scale, and 
foreign deposits. 
Be careful not to overdo borders. In corridors, a border of approximately 9 inches wide is appropriate. 

09 70 00 WALL FINISHES 

Wall materials must be chosen based on the function of the facility and the materials of the adjacent 
structures. The goal is to limit the pallet of materials used on base and ease the transition between the 
wide variety of existing materials by adjusting the proportions and details of the approved materials. 
Consistent application of colors and materials will bind the base together and reduce visual clutter caused 
by too much diversity. 

Use only base standard materials and colors. Minimize surfaces requiring painting and cleaning. 

Use integral colored materials and factory finished building products to reduce maintenance. 

Use sealant to match or blend with surface materials and color. 

09 72 00 Wall Coverings 

Do not use vinyl wall coverings and other wall coverings, paneling, paints, solid back splashes, and other 
materials that do not breathe because it can create a second vapor barrier trapping moisture within 
construction and cause mold growth. 

09 90 00 PAINTING AND COATING 

09 91 00 Painting 

Partial or spot painting is not acceptable. If part of a surface requires painting, then the entire surface will 
have to be painted or repainted in order to reach a corner or a different material.

Water stops to prevent additional water from getting under the slab from the exterior of the building at the 
wall/ footing joint. 

Two methods are specified to meet the requirements for flood openings in walls of enclosures below 
elevated buildings, to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater: nonengineered openings that 
do not require certification (1 square inch per square foot of enclosed area), and engineered openings 
that must be certified by a registered design professional. The performance of engineered openings must 
account for the presence of louvers, blades, screens, grilles, faceplates, or other covers and devices and 
must ensure that the difference between the exterior and interior floodwater levels does not exceed 
1 foot. Installation of all flood openings must be in at least two walls and must be no more than 1 foot 
above the higher of the interior grade or floor and the finished exterior grade immediately under each 
opening.

components requiring storage, are often misplaced, or lost, and require more installation time. 

Vertical Coiling (Roll-Up) Hurricane Shutters 

Assembly should be recessed into the wall opening flush with wall plane. If roll-up housing protrudes past 
the wall plane, the top must be sloped to discourage bird nesting and to prevent corrosion from standing 
rain water. All coiling shutters must have interior manual operations or electronic operation with manual 
back-up operation. 

Casement (Side Hinged) Hurricane Shutters 

Side-hinged Colonial casement-type shutters must be hardened with a 1/4-inch (7 mm)-thick minimum 
solid polycarbonate panel on the interior side attached with Type 316 stainless-steel hardware and 
fasteners. Securing brackets of Type 316 stainless steel must be an integral part of the shutters 
(nonremovable), and mechanically locked to secure shutters in closed position. 

Sun-control devices must be integrated on the building exteriors to shield direct sunlight on glazing and to 
reduce cooling load and glare while maximizing daylight to interior spaces. These devices must be 
integrated into the building construction so they do not appear as an afterthought addition, do not collect 
dirt, and allow for easy window cleaning. Sun-control devices may include overhangs, canopies, louvers,

operate in a safe, consistent, and efficient manner, within acceptable tolerances for face velocities 
specified. Dead air pockets and reverse air currents will not be permitted along surface of hood 
interiors. Negative variations of face velocity must not exceed 20% of the average face velocity. 
• 
Static Pressure Loss: Design fume hoods to minimize static pressure loss. Static pressure loss 
through the VAV restricted bypass fume hoods must be no more than 0.20 inch of water gauge when 
hood operates at the containment requirements listed in this specification. 
• 
Containment per ASHRAE 110: Provide fume hoods that have a face velocity of 100 feet per minute 
(fpm) (0.51 meter per second [m/s]) and a release rate of 4.0 liter per minute (Lpm) when tested 
according to ASHRAE 110: 
– VAV bypass low-velocity fume hood(s) at a face velocity of 84 fpm with sash at 18 inches open 
and 55 fpm with sash at 28 inches open 
– As-Manufactured Rating: AM 0.05 (0.05 ppm]

DIVISION 12 FURNISHINGS 

Design and installation of furnishing must be designed and installed for the program wind speed 
requirements (USAF, 2019a). Such furnishings must be designed and detailed to meet all requirements of 
the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone provisions of the latest edition of the FBC for the applicable sections 
related to their material types. Furnishings must also be designed for strength, security, and heavy use. 

All manufactured products falling under this category must have a current Miami-Dade NOA that 
demonstrates compliance with the wind pressures determined from the wind speed. 

12 20 00 WINDOW TREATMENTS 

12 21 00 Window Blinds 

Provide 1-inch aluminum mini-blinds with a wand for manual tilt operation and pull chord to raise and 
lower blinds. Vertical blinds collect less dust than horizontal ones and are encouraged. 

12 24 00 Sun Control Devices 

Sun-control devices must be integrated on the building exteriors to shield direct sunlight on glazing and to 
reduce cooling load and glare while maximizing daylight to interior spaces. These devices must be 
integrated into the building construction so they do not appear as an afterthought addition. Units must be 
designed so they do not collect dirt and allow for easy window cleaning. Sun-control devices may include 
overhangs, canopies, louvers, solar screens, and trellises. Light shelves installed on the exterior (and/or 
interior) of windows are another type of shading device that increase light penetration into the building 
interior. Elements typically include horizontal, vertical, cantilevered, and suspended, supports and 
surfaces. The material for exterior sun control devices may be of concrete or aluminum. Elements 
connected to the window, storefront, or curtainwall framing systems must be provided as a part of that 
system to ensure supplier and fabricator address connections and loads. 

12 26 00 Interior Daylighting Devices 

Interior automated sun control devices (for example, roller shade window treatments) may also be 
deployed during portions of the day to mitigate heat gain and glare. 

Interior automated sun control devices (for example, roller shade window treatments), controlled by 
daylight sensors may also be deployed during portions of the day to mitigate heat gain and glare.

automatically restarted after a power interruption. 
o 
Equipment startup must be delayed by a preset adjustable time period specified by the 
operator using the touch screen display. 
o 
All alarm activity except hardwired safety limit controls can be disabled for an adjustable 
preset time period after power up to allow the restarted room to achieve its setpoint 
conditions without alarming or shutting down due to alarm response activity. The time 
period is adjusted on the touch screen display and a visual indicator on the display will 
alert the operator while the inhibit function is active.

DIVISION 23 HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIRCONDITIONING 
(HVAC) 

The HVAC systems must support Tyndall AFB as an Installation of the Future. Designs must incorporate 
resilience, sustainability, and SMART technologies focusing on areas of energy efficiency, appropriate 
life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), flood and environmental protection for equipment, metering, and 
monitoring and commissioning. 

Building function, climate, and location must be included in the analysis when selecting a mechanical 
system. Passive design aspects must be included in the mechanical system designs. For example, actual 
building envelope materials, shading, and air barriers must be included in equipment sizing. 

The primary method of space conditioning will be ducted HVAC systems that use a building-wide chilled 
water loop for cooling and a building-wide hot water loop for heating. Individual split systems, window 
units, and fan coil units are not preferred. 

Durability, availability of replacement parts in the local area (near Tyndall AFB), maintainability, type of 
warranty, and service from local manufacturing representatives must be taken into consideration during 
design and procurement. 

All other HVAC equipment not explicitly defined must be designed for the program wind speed 
requirements (USAF, 2019a). Such HVAC equipment must be designed and detailed to meet all 
requirements of the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone provisions of the latest edition of the FBC for the 
applicable sections related to their material types. 

23 00 00 HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING (HVAC) 

• 
When possible, the use of central cooling plants for adjacent buildings are highly encouraged. 
Cooling plants must be designed for energy efficiency, flexibility, and resiliency. 
• 
Use values from the latest version of UFC 3-400-02, Engineering Weather Data. Do not use ASHRAE 
design temperatures. 
• 
Tyndall AFB has corrosive, salt-laden air that accelerates degradation of materials. Infrastructure 
must be designed and installed to accomplish design performance and life spans in an aggressively 
corrosive marine environment. Designs must address measures taken to resist the effects of 
corrosion. 
• 
Sand entrained in the wind has a sand blasting effect on infrastructure at Tyndall AFB. Corrosion-
resistant coatings that have been subjected to scratches or nicks do not prevent the establishment of 
corrosion cells that degrade materials. It is, therefore, important that intrinsically corrosion-resistant 
materials, such as Type 316 stainless steel, for example, be used for outdoor enclosures and for 
structural support. 
•

systems using the ventilation rates in ASHRAE 170, Ventilation of Health Care Facilities (with 
errata), or the requirements of the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) Guidelines for Design and 
Construction of Health Care Facilities. For any area not covered in ASHRAE 170 or the FGI 
guidelines, follow ASHRAE 62.1 or a local equivalent, whichever is more stringent and meets the 
minimum requirements of ASHRAE 170. 
– For commercial kitchen spaces, makeup air velocity near (or directed at) the hood is less than 
75 fpm, replacement air introduced directly into the exhaust hood cavity does not exceed 10% of

Split DDC systems into below-DFE and above-DFE zones so that loss of submerged areas does not 
impact the rest of the building. The communication network and power source for these panels should 
be separated by their relationship to the DFE. This will keep communication errors from a damaged 
panel creating excessive “traffic” on the network, thus slowing or freezing communication on the 
balance of the network. Additionally, the power source for BAS equipment at or below the DFE should 
not service equipment above the DFE. If properly arranged, an equipment short will not interrupt 
power to panels operating above the DFE (USAF, 2019b).

Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD): Provide documentation on which analytics rules apply to 
the equipment used and include instrumentation required to implement selected FDD rules. The 
purpose of the FDD system is to analyze data produced by utility meters and building systems in 
order to identify faults, trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improved performance and reduced 
energy use in the operation of facility equipment systems. 
• 
CMMS Integration: Coordinate connection to existing TRIRIGA or other CMMS/Enterprise Asset 
Management System (EAMS). The integrated automation platform, including FDD module, must 
include the capability to both automatically and manually generate work orders in the Tyndall AFB 
CMMS or EAMS. The final configuration (automatic or manual) will be determined on a project by 
project basis. 
• 
Automatic Notification: The integrated automation platform must provide automatic notification of 
detected issues via email as well as automated emailing of reports. The rules and conditions that 
trigger automated notification must be created in consultation with Tyndall AFB staff. 
The UOC should accommodate operational control of traffic signals and other intelligent transportation 
systems (ITS). 

Conduit and dedicated 144-strand single-mode fiber must be placed along all reconstructed and new 
roadways. Pull boxes will be needed at regularly spaced intervals to access transportation ITS fiber.

26 30 00 FACILITY ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATING AND 
STORING EQUIPMENT 

The generator set (genset) will provide emergency power when the grid is down, allowing critical mission 
and mission-critical activities to continue. The combination of powering the distribution system and smart 
switches to manage loads must allow the genset to power many operations that do not have their own 
backup generators and provide redundancy to locations that have backup generators. A dual-fuel genset 
also serves as a backup power source if local diesel fuel supplies are compromised for the individual 
backup generators, thereby providing multiple layers of resiliency. 

Natural disasters that affect the base may also adversely affect the surrounding region. Consequently, the 
base may be in competition for the replenishment of diesel fuel for emergency power generation. Adding 
diesel storage onsite enhances the base’s ability to continue electric service to critical mission activities in 
the face of regional fuel shortages. 

26 31 00 Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Components 

PV will provide emergency electric power when the grid is down, allowing critical mission and mission-
critical activities to continue for an extended period. The combination of PV and battery energy storage 
systems provide further resiliency and redundancy to the electrical power supply. 

26 32 13.13 Diesel-Engine-Driven Generator Sets 

In addition to submittals listed in the UFGS document, if the genset uses compressed air for starting, the 
design data for the compressed air starting system must be submitted. 

The power rating of the genset will generally be in accordance with NFPA 110 as Level 2, Class 4, 
Type 120. Gensets used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be rated as Prime power. 

The genset application designation for units used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be 
designated as “parallel with other generators on an isolated bus.” The genset application designation for 
units used to power individual facilities must be designated as “stand-alone.” 

All generator cooling systems must be closed-loop systems and must use air as the final heat sink. 

The genset enclosure for outdoor installation must be stainless-steel or marine-grade aluminum for a 
marine environment, including wind-blown brackish water. Louvers must be hurricane shutters designed 
per wind requirements. Sound attenuation must result in sound levels not to exceed 85 A-weighted 
decibels (dBA) at 10 feet from surface of enclosure. The preferred muffler location is inside the enclosure. 
Alternatively, the engine-generator set must be enclosed in a structure similar to that described in Naval

26 32 13.19 Dual-Fuel-Engine-Driven Generator Sets (Stationary) 2 MW 

In general, the duel-fuel genset should adhere to the requirements of UFC 3-540-01, Engine-driven 
Generator Systems for Prime and Standby Power Applications, and UFGS 26 32 15.00 10, Diesel-
Generator Set Stationary 100-2500 kW, with Auxiliaries, including the guidelines for UFGS 26 32 15.00 

10. This genset is intended to be connected to the Tyndall AFB distribution grid and operate in island 
mode or isolated in parallel with other generators on the Tyndall AFB distribution grid. 
The unit will be expected to operate on Jet A, instead of diesel fuel, of the same specifications as 
delivered to Tyndall AFB for aviation use but with provision for adding any chemicals necessary to meet 
the engine manufacturer’s minimum fuel specifications regarding lubricity for equipment wear, especially 
the engine fuel pump. The chemical addition unit should be designed to add the chemicals as fuel is 
transferred from the genset’s main fuel storage tank to the day tank. In addition, the genset must be able 
to operate on a mixture of natural gas and Jet A, with a minimum of 30% natural gas in the mixture. The 
genset must be able to shift from 100% liquid fuel to the natural gas/liquid mixture and back without 
losing power. 

Operational classification of the genset will generally be in accordance with NFPA 110 as Level 2, 
Class 4, Type 120. Gensets that will be used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be rated 
as prime power. The genset application designation for units used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution 
system must be considered to be “parallel with other generators on an isolated bus.” 

Fuel consumption limitations and testing as described in UFGS 26 32 15.00 10 paragraphs 2.1.10, 
2.1.11, and 3.6.11 are not applicable. Genset supplier must submit fuel consumption data for 50%, 75%, 
and 100% of rated output capacity for operating cases of 100% Jet A, 30% natural gas/70% Jet A, 50/50 
mixture, and maximum natural gas content allowed mixture. 

Depending on the engine manufacturer and the method of mixing the natural gas and liquid fuel, a gas 
compressor unit may be required to boost the pipeline gas pressure from a nominal 15 psig to the inlet 
pressure required by the engine manufacturer. This unit would consist of a gas compressor (rotary screw 
or reciprocating), inlet filter, suction and discharge bottles, and associated controls, all as a skid-mounted 
unit. The unit would be protected by an enclosure for outdoor installation, stainless-steel or marine 
aluminum, designed for a marine environment, including wind-blown brackish water. Louvers must be 
hurricane shutters designed per Miami/Dade County Risk Category 5. Sound attenuation must result in 
sound levels not to exceed 85 dBA at 10 feet from the surface of the enclosure. Alternatively, the

fuel from the main storage tank to the day tank. The main storage tank with secondary containment 
should include truck unloading facilities and appropriate related appurtenances in accordance with UFC 
3-460-01, Design of Petroleum Fuel Facilities.

the test report before submitting to the Government. 

The test plan must include, along with all testing system reports, a complete project test summary 
spreadsheet with indexed room numbers, outlet labels, jack labels and the pass/fail status, and causes 
for failures along with a total number of outlets installed, jacks/cable runs installed, and the total number 
of jacks/cables runs that passed and failed the tests. 

All failed tests require the contractor to correct the failures prior to turnover of the system. Tier 2 testing 
data analysis is required by the Government at the contractors’ expense if Tier 1 testing does not prove 
adequate for identifying causes of failures, and if the Government is responsible for paying for any repairs 
not within the original scope of contract. 

27 05 40 OSP Schedules 

27 10 00 STRUCTURED CABLING SYSTEM 

27 10 05 TELECOMMUNICATION/EQUIPMENT ROOMS 

27 10 05.1 Communications Entrance Facility 

Per the NEC, non-building rated OSP fiber optic cable entering a building must not exceed 50 feet in 
cable length from the building entrance. 

27 10 05.2 Grounding and Bonding 

Comply with NFPA 70 for grounding and bonding requirements. Provide a telecommunications bonding 
and grounding system in accordance with TIA-607-C or current version. 

Bond all telecommunications racks and supporting metallic structures (cable trays, ladders, conduits, and 
baskets). Non-continuous distribution systems (that is, stub-ups and J-hooks) do not require bonding. 

27 10 05.6 Communications Termination Blocks and Patch Panels 

Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be spliced to the fiber optic cable and dressed into the back side of the 
fiber optic distribution panel (FODP) and splice assembly. 

Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be factory-made pigtail fiber optic cable assemblies with one end blunt 
(splice end) and the other end with factory terminated connectors. 

Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be sized based on actual installation length requirements of each 
installation. 

04 October 2019 


DIVISION 27 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be manufactured with the same cable type and performance 
characteristics as the installed cable it is spliced to. 
FODP must be wall mounted or rack-mounted depending on its location. 

FODP must be sized for one to four rack units. 
All fiber strands must be dressed into the rear of the FODP and presented on the backside of a high-
density housing panel. 

The dressing-in of fiber strands must follow the fiber optic color code standard ensuring all fiber strands 
are kept in a straight-through configuration on both cable ends. 
New FODPs must be from the same original equipment manufacturer as reused existing FODPs. 

27 10 05.7 Communications Cable Management and Ladder Rack 

Do not use ladder cable trays for horizontal distribution due to possible cable deformation with large cable 
quantities. 

27 10 20 Communications Pathways 

For intra-building backbone distribution, provide a minimum of two, 4-inch conduits between 
telecommunications racks (TRs) located on the same floor or pathway that provide equivalent capacity 
(for example, cable tray installed to support backbone and horizontal distribution). 

In multistory buildings, provide a minimum of three, 4-inch conduits, sleeves, or an equivalent-sized slot 
between stacked TRs on successive floors in accordance with TIA-569-C. 

27 10 20.1 Conduits and Backboxes for Communications Systems 

Design conduit systems in accordance with TIA-569-C. 

Install EMT conduit from the cable backbone distribution system, whether cable tray or enclosed duct, to 
each outlet unless a conduit-less system is approved by the telecommunications manager. 

Provide a minimum of 1-inch EMT conduit for standard outlets. 

When cable tray or enclosed duct is not used, install individual conduits from the TR to each outlet. 

Coordinate conduit bend radii with cable bend radius. Arrange conduit entries at outlet and junction boxes 
so cables passing through the box enter and exit at opposite sides of the box. 

Do not use flexible metal conduit for telecommunications wiring except when installing floor-access boxes 
in a raised floor, where the floor-access box may be relocated within a specified service area. In this case 
the length of the flexible metal conduit must not exceed a length of 20 feet (6 meters) for each run per 
TIA-569-C. 

Avoid using in-slab and below-grade conduit systems for interior telecommunications designs because 
these systems provide the least flexible horizontal distribution system. If an in-slab or below-grade conduit 
system is used in the telecommunications design, comply with NFPA 70 and use cables listed and rated 
for wet locations. 

Do not use plenum-or riser-rated cable, gel-filled OSP, and unlisted cables in such an environment. 
Consider that cables rated for a wet location typically have a larger outside diameter, and this may affect 
conduit fill rates and conduit sizing. 

04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 27 

Larger conduit sizing in the slab may affect the structural integrity of the structure. For in-floor conduit 
systems, provide home runs back to the TR serving that area. Serve all telecommunications outlets from 
the TR located on that floor. 

Use an optimal conduit fill ratio of 40% for conduit sizing. Do not exceed a fill ratio of 50%. 
Do not install more than four, four-pair cables in a 1-inch conduit. 
Place pull and splice boxes in conduit runs in accordance with TIA-569-C. 

27 10 20.2 Cable Trays for Communications Systems 

The DoD-required horizontal pathway is a ceiling distribution system employing a centralized cable tray 
system originating in the telecommunications space and continuing out into the serving areas. 

Use cable tray for horizontal distribution to the maximum extent possible (80 to 90% of the horizontal 
cable length). 

The remaining pathway to the work area outlet may be implemented in a variety of ways combining 
conduit, non-continuous cable supports, and stub-ups/outs. 

Use solid bottom, slotted bottom, or welded wire cable tray to provide a centralized cable 
management/distribution system. 

Design cable trays to accommodate an initial calculated fill ratio of 25%. 

The maximum fill ratio of any cable tray is 50%. (Note: This allows for future growth within the cable tray. 
Due to random placement of cables and space between the cables, a 25% fill ratio means that in reality 
the tray is half-filled.) 

The maximum fill depth of any cable tray is 6 inches. 

Provide and maintain a minimum of 12 inches access headroom above a cable tray system or 
cable runway. 

27 10 20.4 Hangers and Supports for Communications Systems 

The use of J hooks, flexible cable tray(s), and alternative support systems specifically certified for the 
cable used is permissible to support cable extensions from the cable tray. 
Do not exceed a 50% fill ratio for the J hooks. 
Support must be provided for horizontal cabling to distribution areas in cable tray(s). 
Non-continuous cable supports are not allowed in the following: 

• 
In place of the cable tray system or as the sole distribution system in place of home-run conduit. 
Design non-continuous cable supports to support the category-rating of the cable. Supports must not 
exceed 20 cables or 50% of the fill capacity, whichever is less. 
• 
Locations that exceed 50 feet (15 meters) total length through a non-continuous cable support 
system. 
• 
In ceilings in which infection control protocol affects ceiling tile removal. 
• 
In areas where the cable must be protected. 
When using non-continuous cable supports, provide in accordance with TIA-569-C.

27 10 40 Communications Horizontal Distribution System 
27 10 40.2 Communications Optical Fiber Horizontal Cabling 

Cabling must meet or exceed the manufacturer’s specifications and ANSI/TIA-568-C.3, Optical Fiber 
Cabling Components Standards to include cable transmission performances, minimum cable bend radius, 
and cable pull strength/pull tensions. 

27 10 48 Cable Splicing And Terminations 
27 10 48.2 Communications Optical Fiber Splicing and Terminations 

Splicing 

Fiber optic splicing must be fusion splicing. Fusion splices must be tested with a multifunctional splice 
machine/tester at the time of the splice. The splicing of all fiber strands must use the fiber optic color code 
standard ensuring all fiber strands are kept in a straight-through configuration through the splice. Indoor-
rated fiber optic splice case enclosures must be used for wall-mounted and rack-mounted applications. 

Terminations 

Field-terminated fiber optic connectors must conform to the following standards: 

• 
TIA/EIA-455-21 
• 
TIA/EIA-568-B 

• 
TIA/EIA-604-3, Intermateability Standards 
Field-terminated fiber optic connector insertion loss must be 0.25 decibels (dB) maximum. The connector 
durability must have a maximum insertion loss change not to exceed 0.3 dB after 200 insertions. 
Field terminated fiber optic connectors must have a dust cap installed on ferule and connector housing. 
Field terminated fiber optic connectors must be epoxy-based and SC, LC, or similar. 

27 10 60 Radio Frequency Systems 
27 10 60.1 Wireless Access Points 

Provide two twisted-pair cables, Category 6 or 6A terminated on standard eight-pin modular connectors 
or two fiber multimode optical fiber strands, which are OM3 or higher for each wireless access point. 

Include the cable tray and conduit or J-hooks to support the cable connected to the wireless access point.

32 12 00 Flexible Paving 

The hot mix asphalt used for shared-use paths must be composed of 100% RAP. 

Pervious asphalt paving must not be used within roadways or UFC-required parking areas on base. 
Parking lots provided beyond the minimum parking requirements per the UFC (that is, overflow parking) 
must use permeable paving systems. 

In addition to UFC standards, roadway, shared-use path, sidewalk, driveway, and parking lot pavement 
must be designed in accordance with Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Design Manuals, 
FDOT Pavement Type Selection Manual, and FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual. 

All vehicular roadway surfaces must use hardened pavement to protect the facility from storm damage 
and ensure longer pavement life-cycle. 

See Division 34, Transportation, for road section requirements. 

Long-Life Pavement Design 

• 
Long-life pavement design must be in accordance with a design procedure that is formally 
recognized, adopted, and documented by the project owner. In many instances (but not all), this 
could be the process described in American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials’ (AASHTO’s) Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, 4th Edition with 1998 Supplement or 
the process described in AASHTO’s Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide, Interim Edition: 
A Manual of Practice. 
• 
Design at least 75% of the total new or reconstructed pavement surface area for regularly trafficked 
lanes of pavement must meet long-life pavement design criteria. This means 75% of the total surface 
area of all traveled lanes is designed for long life. Shoulders, medians, sidewalks, and other incidental 
paved areas are not included in this calculation. 
• 
Design and specify that 100% of the total new or reconstructed asphalt pavement for regularly 
traveled lanes must use materials and technologies to achieve a field construction density of 94% of 
the maximum theoretical density. The density at construction must represent the in-place density after 
the asphalt mixture has been compacted with the rollers but prior to opening the roadway to traffic. 
32 13 00 Rigid Paving 

Pervious concrete paving must not be used within roadways or UFC-required parking areas on base. 

In addition to UFC standards, roadways, shared-use paths, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lot 
pavement must be designed in accordance with FDOT Design Manuals, FDOT Pavement Type Selection 
Manual, FDOT Rigid Pavement Design Manual, and FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual. 

All vehicular roadway surfaces must use hardened pavement to protect the facility from storm damage 
and ensure longer pavement life-cycle.

Porous paving systems may be used as approved by the base to further control site runoff. The system 
must be placed over an aggregate storage bed and include an overflow system connected to a storm 
drain. Using permeable pavement is a low-impact development technique that can be used as part of a 
Roadway Stormwater Management Plan. However, permeable pavers may require maintenance. This 
type of system must be considered in limited cases: 

• 
Limited vehicular traffic 
• 
The site must benefit from the aesthetic value provided 
• 
Design must accommodate maintenance needs 
Paved plazas must have restrained edges through the use of adjacent existing pavement, flush concrete 
curb, or metal edge restraint. Paving design pattern should include a paver band, such as a solider or a 
sailor course. Pavers must have clean tight cuts to fit against elements within the paved plaza. 

Pavers must be concrete pavers of the approved color, size, and finish. Color range must complement 
architecture materials. Pervious pavers must be used only in areas that do not receive high volumes of 
foot traffic. Select materials that can withstand high winds and a marine salt environment.

shade structures are not allowed over seating or dugouts. Metal bleachers on a flat concrete pad are not 
allowed. Provide benches for teams on football fields and bleachers for spectators on the football/soccer 
fields. Running tracks must use a high level, poured rubber surface that will last at least 20 years. Provide 
hose bibs at each facility for maintenance. Provide potable water at all fields for use by players and 
coaches. All benches and shelters must be able to withstand high winds and flood conditions of salt 
water. Provide restroom and concession buildings as required by Owner.

32 72 00 Wetlands Restoration 

When restoring a wetland, river, streams, lakes, or ponds, follow the process below and provide 
associated documentation to prove the effectives of the restoration. Refer to MASTER PLANNING for 
ecosystem conservation. 

• 
Use site plan and ecological assessment to identify and describe the geographic extent of the existing 
degraded, damaged, or destroyed aquatic ecosystems and proposed areas of restoration. 
– Include calculations and dimensions of the existing and proposed restored geographic extent of 
the aquatic ecosystems to prove restoration has been achieved. Reference site conditions may 
need to be used to determine existing calculations. 
• 
Restore the geographic extent of the aquatic ecosystem within the project boundary for 100% of the 
geographic extent. 
• 
Develop a restoration plan based on the Nine Attributes of Restored Ecosystems (below). 
– Description of the reference site conditions to show the restored aquatic eco-system has the 
same native plant communities, appropriate aquatic habitat, water quality improvements, and 
stable bank or shoreline conditions. 
– Narrative describing how the project meets the goals and objectives of the latest edition of the 
Society of Ecological Restoration’s Attributes of Restored Ecosystems. 
– Narrative describing the restoration strategies implemented for each aquatic ecosystem to be 
restored. 
– Restoration of river and stream channels (if any) must also be inclusive of their respective 
floodplain and riparian zone. Restoration of lakes and ponds (if any) must also be inclusive of 
their respective shorelines. 
• 
Signature from a restoration ecologist or recognized expert verifying the restoration plan has been 
designed to achieve the above-listed required goals and objectives. 
Attributes of Restored Ecosystems (from the Society for Ecological Restoration’s International Primer 
on Ecological Restoration) 

1) The restored ecosystem contains a characteristic assemblage of the species that occur in the 
reference ecosystem and that provide appropriate community structure. 
2) The restored ecosystem consists of indigenous species to the greatest practicable extent. 
3) All functional groups necessary for the continued development and/or stability of the restored 
ecosystem are represented or, if not, the missing groups have the potential to colonize by natural 
means. 
4) The physical environment of the restored ecosystem is capable of sustaining reproducing populations 
of the species necessary for its continued stability or development along the desired trajectory. 
5) The restored ecosystem apparently functions normally for its ecological stage of development, and 
signs of dysfunction are absent. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 32 

6) The restored ecosystem is suitably integrated into a larger ecological matrix or landscape, with which 
it interacts through abiotic and biotic flows and exchanges. 
7) Potential threats to the health and integrity of the restored ecosystem from the surrounding landscape 
have been eliminated or reduced as much as possible. 
8) The restored ecosystem is sufficiently resilient to endure the normal periodic stress events in the local 
environment that serve to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem. 
9) The restored ecosystem is self-sustaining to the same degree as its reference system and has the 
potential to persist indefinitely under existing environmental conditions. 
32 80 00 IRRIGATION 

Potable water use for irrigation purposes is not allowed per UFC 1-200-02. Rainwater harvesting or other 
alternative means is acceptable in some cases as a water source for landscape irrigation. 

Where irrigation for a project is to be provided by rainwater collection, coordinate the design with the 
building mechanical and plumbing system designs to allow the collection of HVAC condensate and 
rainwater from roof drain systems. 

In isolated areas of Tyndall AFB where maintaining the quality of domestic water requires periodic 
flushing of watermains, the base may consider an irrigation system. The system must be sized to use the 
planned volume and frequency of flushing, and no more domestic water than was planned for water 
quality maintenance must be used. 

32 90 00 PLANTING 

Landscape Design Concept 

The landscape design must be defined by four zones: Natural Perimeter Zone, Transition Zone, 
Maintained Zone, and Flight Line Zone. 

Natural Perimeter Zone: This zone encompasses all perimeter areas and large unused areas among 
groups of buildings. The zone must have native grasses, shrubs, and trees that are local to the 
environment and as recommended by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service recommendations for what is 
currently being used on the base in the natural areas. 

Transition Zone: The Transition Zone must contain mostly native wire and Indian grasses. It will be 
mowed only twice per year when recommend. 

Maintained Zone: This zone is located around the immediate perimeter of a building or the center of a 
main space , such as the town center. Areas in this zone will have turf grass that will be mowed on a 
regular basis to keep a manicured look. The zone should be drought resistant and also contain native 
trees for shade and ornamental grasses and native shrubs for color and variety. Ornamental grasses and 
shrubs should be located in areas close to building entrances. Design should be simple in nature but bold 
in color. All landscaping should be to maintain. 

Flight Line Zone: The Flight Line Zone is similar to the Maintained Zone except that tree use should be 
limited and not be planted close to the runway. Trees should be placed further back toward the second 
row of structures. Trees should be limited to species that do not attract birds. 

04 October 2019 


DIVISION 32 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

Xeriscape Design Principles 

Minimizing Water Requirements 

The base will have limited irrigation except in the Maintained Zone, which might receive water through a 
rainwater harvesting system. Use plant species that are native and drought-tolerant. Temporary irrigation 
may be used to establish plantings once they are first planted but not after one growing season. 

Plant Material Selection 

Plant selection must be as specified herein. Contractor/designer has the ability to modify the planting 
pallet as long as it is approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife representative on the base. It must be native 
and found in the local environment having shown resiliency to drought and establishment in native soils. 

Water Budgeting (Hydrozones) 

Streetscape Landscaping 

Street landscaping must be similar to the zone in which it is planted, most likely in the Transition Zone. 
Bioswales should use planting recommended by Florida Fish and Wildlife that is capable of living in 
varied conditions of short-term flooding to drought. Major streets should be lined with native trees to 
provide shade and direct traffic. Trees must be planted on the land side of sidewalks and not between 
sidewalks and curbs. 

Parking Lot Landscaping 

Parking lots should have native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses arranged in large groups to form a 
designed look instead of a native, organic look. For islands with drainage, plants should be able to 
withstand the same conditions specified for bioswales. Use trees for shade where appropriate. Do not 
plant trees in small island spaces; plant them in the outside perimeter of the parking lot or in islands that 
are no less than 10 feet wide. 

Screen/Accent Landscaping 

Plantings for screening shall must be native and evergreen of medium height. 

Drip Irrigation Zones (Special Irrigation) 

Drip irrigation will be used in shrub planting areas adjacent to building entrances where special planting 
occurs. The water should not be potable and should come from rainwater harvesting. 

Temporary Irrigation 

Temporary irrigation will be used by the contractor to establish all plantings for one growing season as 
part of their contract. After one season, planting must be weaned off water over a 6 month period to allow 
plants to acclimate to local conditions. 

32 93 00 Plants 

Conserve and use appropriate plants. 

Native and adapted non-invasive plans help to maintain ecosystem service, increase biodiversity, provide 
wildlife habitat, and require minimum maintenance. Projects must remove invasive species found onsite, 
conserve existing appropriate plants, and only use appropriate plants for installation. 

• 
Conduct an assessment that shows existing vegetated area and distinguishes which plants are 
existing native species. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 32 

• 
Conserve existing native and adapted non-invasive plants onsite. If removal of existing native and 
adapted non-invasive plants occurs, install new appropriate plants to equal 100% of final site 
vegetated area. 
– New native plant calculations are measured by surface area of final vegetated area, using 
estimated vegetated cover within 10 years of installation. 
• 
Appropriate plant species are species suitable for site conditions, climate, and design intent. Both 
native and non-native plants may qualify. The list below shows invasive species as designed by 
Federal or qualifying regional lists: 
– State or local lists (when listing occurs through a vetted, transparent process and has been 
accepted by regional stakeholders) 
– The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS Database 
– Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States website 
– State and Federal Noxious Weed laws 
• 
Potable water for landscaping irrigation is prohibited on the base. All plant materials must require no 
permanent irrigation after establishment period, unless greywater or harvested rainwater is used for 
irrigation. 
32 94 00 Planting Accessories 

Tree Grates 

Grates should be used sparingly. Trees will do better if planted 
in grass or other soft areas instead of paved areas. The grate 
must be aluminum and also must have a powder coat finish to 
resist rusting.

33 01 12 Inspection and Testing of Water Utilities 

Modeling of the water system age and the predicted chlorine residual levels based on an updated and 
maintained hydraulic model of the base-wide water distribution system must be completed when system 
modifications are made or updated information about the water supply is available from Bay County. The 
model must be used to predict areas that may experience low residual chlorine levels (an indicator of 
possible low water quality). Testing stations must be installed to monitor chlorine residual levels in these 
areas and report results via the SCADA system to the UOC.

Warning tape must be provided for all new underground utility installations installed by open cut methods. 

33 09 10 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) for Utility 
Operations Centers 

The SCADA system must monitor and control the reconfigured base electrical distribution system from 
the utility inter-tie points for the base-looped configuration using protection relays and associated devices. 
The system must be configured as a self-healing topology to the extent possible with engineering access 
to the protection and control systems to maximize uptime, increase safety, reliability, efficiency, and 
capacity for base improvements. 

The SCADA system must be operated from the UOC, which will be located in a new building near the 
Base Emergency Operations Center (EOC) facility. The UOC must be watched for normal operations 
24/7, and when a base emergency is declared, additional staff will report to the base EOC and interface 
with the emergency management team at the remote UOC workstation. 

The UOC should not be confused with a National Operations Center, Regional Operations Center, or the 
overall base EOC. 

The following design criteria apply to the utilities SCADA system and its associated UOC control room: 

• 
Determine the most advantageous alignments using the pad-mounted switchgear switch and 
protected ways with the local load manual switches. Provide a system topology using a redundant 
ring for overall network communications, multiple sub-rings, and radial links (point-to-point) as 
required for efficient and effective system communications. 
• 
Provide communications processors, data concentrators, remote terminal units, remote input/output 
(I/O) units, controllers, global positioning system time clock, secure gateways, and firewalls. 
Demilitarized zones, event messaging, and associated software packages for the operations 
monitoring, control, and inter-equipment signal processing must maintain the functional and 
operational integrity of the system. 
• 
Interface with the electrical distribution system (including the utility connection point), base water 
utilities (water, waste water, sewer systems), smart street light system, and the EMCS that monitors 
various facilities throughout the base for monitoring and control functionality. 
• 
Provide continuous monitoring of the system and perform remedial actions in the event of an 
electrical fault or other system disturbance through communications with the protective relays and 
other monitoring devices. Protective relaying functions include bus, feeder, inter-tie, transformer, 
switchgear, generator, and arc-flash protection. 
• 
Provide primary system communications via IEC-61850 with GOOSE messaging; system must also 
be able to communicate with multiple protocols, including DNP 3.0, Modbus, and Multimedia 
Messaging Service (MMS)Client as needed. 
• 
Provide components and redundant ethernet communications among the SCADA servers, SCADA 
terminals, Engineering Laptop (acts as the Engineering Workstation), and any vendor object linking 
and embedding for process control (OPC)v I/O servers to allow monitoring and control operations. 
• 
Provide a minimum of two Operator Work Stations in the UOC control room with the requisite number 
of bookcases, drawings files, large screen wall monitors, phones, radios, printers, and other 
associated equipment for a fully functional system.

33 10 00 WATER UTILITIES 

Water utility project teams must develop strategies to reduce overall water consumption through the use 
of greywater, recycled water, and stormwater to meet non-potable water needs. 

In coordination with the S+R Coordinator, project teams must complete and document the following: 

• 
Planning and design reviews to identify potable water reduction strategies for the project life cycle. 
• 
Identify the AF baseline for potable water use for the project type. 
•

percentage of savings through water reduction strategies. 
• 
Develop a Monitoring and Management Plan to compare estimated savings to actual performance. 
33 12 00 Surface Water Sources 

Tyndall AFB is located in the St. Andrew Bay Watershed. To address watershed-level sustainability and 
resiliency, water utility project teams must evaluate impacts to the watershed and reduce net negative 
impacts on fresh water availability and quantity, and also identify measures for making positive 
contributions to watershed protection. The St. Andrew Bay Watershed Surface Water Improvement and 
Management (SWIM) plan describes watershed resources and issues and provides a comprehensive, 
basin-wide management strategy as the regional guiding framework. 

Water utility project teams must work with the S+R Coordinator (as required in Division 01) and the SWIM 
plan framework to address and provide documentation for the following: 

• 
Assess the project’s watershed context and the watershed-scale fresh water issues, including 
location, type, quantity, rate of recharge, and quality of water resources, as well as source and 
impacts of water used and the destination and impacts of wastewater. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 33 

• 
Establish estimates of water usage and wastewater generation during the life of the project. 
• 
Develop a Strategic Water Management Plan that includes design features and technology to reduce, 
as much as feasible, the identified negative impacts and improve watershed-scale issues with net-
zero impact as the ultimate goal. 
33 16 00 Water Utility Storage Tanks 

Tanks for the storage and supply of water for domestic use must be elevated to provide pressure to the 
water system in the event of a loss of electrical power. Elevated storage tanks must be constructed of 
steel meeting all requirements of the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone provisions of the latest edition of the 
FBC (Chapter 22, Sections 2214 through 2224). 

Domestic water storage and supply tanks must be designed to meet the provisions of Risk Category IV. 

When a new tank is required to meet additional storage needs, an updated model of the water distribution 
system must be created. The size, elevation, and connection design must be tested to verify that the 
operation of the new tank can meet the resiliency goals for additional storage while maintaining 
water quality. 

33 19 00 Water Utility Metering Equipment 

Water utility project teams must install real-time water monitoring equipment and software to improve 
water quality and efficiency, reduce leakage, and/or conserve water. Working with the S+R Coordinator, 
project teams must document the following: 

• 
Location, purpose, and type of monitoring equipment installed 
• 
Plan for using the data to improve operational water performance 
• 
Plan for integrating the monitoring equipment and data management with the SCADA system and 
UOC 
33 30 00 SANITARY SEWERAGE 

33 32 00 Sanitary Sewerage Equipment 

Where gravity collection systems are not possible due to topography or other existing site conditions, 
sanitary sewer pumping stations must be installed. The system design must make use of gravity mains 
to the greatest extent possible. Pumping stations should be designed to serve multiple buildings 
where possible. 

All pump stations must meet these minimum requirements: 

• 
Dual pumps must be used. 
• 
Parallel force mains must be installed with a minimum of 5-foot clearance between pipes. Each main 
must connect directly to one of the dual pumps at the station, and piping and valves must be provided 
to allow shifting of flow between the pumps and force mains. 
• 
Additional wet well storage must be provided to account for a minimum of 3 hours of design flow 
above the level of the emergency alarm, unless site constraints make this infeasible. 
• 
Standby power generation can be provided by a dedicated generator or be designed in to a system 
for a nearby facility.

DIVISION 33 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

33 40 00 Stormwater Conveyance 

Where not financially impractical or waived by the base, all conveyance systems must be designed to 
maintain the hydraulic gradeline calculated for the 25-year design storm below ground level in piping 
systems. For areas drained by open channels, culverts, and connected detention/retention areas at no 
time should stormwater flows overtop a roadway. 

33 44 43 Vortex-Type Hydrodynamic Separators 

Where large areas of pavement are likely to generate large quantities of suspended solids in runoff or 
where a greater-than-normal possibility of oils or other pollutants is present, a Manufactured Treatment 
Device must be installed. This must function as a pretreatment of stormwater upstream of entering 
landscaped or infiltration-based water quality systems or other detention/retention facilities. The units 
selected must adhere to the following requirements: 

• 
Be certified for 80% total suspended solids removal by the New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection or the State of Washington Department of Ecology 
• 
Provide storage for oil and other floatable contaminants 
• 
Be of a general design that allows ease of maintenance under the existing contract for similar work on 
base 
Devices not approved by the referenced organizations may be considered after review of design and 
testing documentation showing compliance with the above requirements and similar testing methods 
required to earn the certifications. 

33 46 00 Stormwater Management 

All stormwater management facilities must be designed and constructed to accomplish the water quality 
requirements of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Northwest Florida Water 
Management District. 

Project teams must exceed UFC 3-210-10 for Low Impact Development through designs that manage 
stormwater runoff to meet the following performance requirements: 

• 
100% of 95th percentile local 24-hour event is infiltrated, evapotranspirated, or reused onsite 
• 
If infiltration, evapotranspiration, or reuse are not permitted, infeasible, or impracticable then detain 
and treat 150% of 95th percentile 24-hour event 
• 
Rate or quantity of runoff for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year 24-hour rainfall event relative to the 
existing condition (greenfield, greyfield, or brownfield) cannot be exceeded 
• 
For treatment of any precipitation volume not retained the treatment practices implemented must 
achieve, at a minimum, an average discharge concentration of less than or equal to 25 mg/L total 
suspended solids for the volume treated 
• 
In cases where receiving waters are impaired or threatened by specific pollutants of concern, 
treatment must be provided for these pollutants 
Project teams must evaluate and use as appropriate the following stormwater management design 
strategies: 

• 
Design to minimize impervious surfaces; when and where possible specify permeable materials for 
hard surfaces, including permeable concrete, asphalt, and pavers. 
• 
Design hard surfaces to drain into localized, onsite landscape areas, and design landscape areas to 
accept precipitation runoff from hard surfaces. 
04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 33 

• 
Provide infiltration opportunities in the landscape that use plants and healthy soils as filters, such as 
bioswales, raingardens, water quality ponds, constructed wetlands, or vegetated buffers, that filter, 
infiltrate, evapotranspirate, and retain precipitation, recharge groundwater, and reduce pollutant 
loadings, runoff volumes, and rates. 
• 
Where runoff conveyance systems are needed, use vegetated channels when possible. Where 
vegetated channels are not practical, the use of hard, non-erosive materials to convey surface water 
should take precedence over using pipes, culverts, or underground channels. 
• 
Create living landscapes using soil and vegetation features, such as vegetated roofs, walls, or 
facades; raingardens; or tree canopies. 
• 
Select appropriate vegetation features that can tolerate periodic inundation and soil saturation without 
harming the growth or vigor of the plant. 
• 
When selecting vegetation for managing precipitation runoff, select plants resistant or less 
susceptible to pollutants commonly found in precipitation runoff. 
• 
Where possible, select plants appropriate for the site and climate based on their capacity to reduce 
pollutant loadings for specific pollutants of concern in the receiving watershed. 
• 
Improve the water-retention capacity of the soil by increasing the organic matter content of the soil 
through the addition of compost or other organic soil amendments. 
• 
Use rainwater-harvesting systems to reduce precipitation runoff volumes and rates. Design rainwater 
harvesting and use systems to maintain the ecological flows of receiving waters and historical 
groundwater recharge rates. 
• 
Avoid or minimize the use of materials used in buildings, hardscape, and landscape construction that 
can be a source of pollutants in stormwater, such as, copper and zinc roofs, roof gutters, downspouts, 
and siding, galvanized materials (for example, fences, fence posts, guardrails, signposts), and treated 
lumber. 
• 
Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices to control pests. 
• 
Minimize the use of fertilizers onsite, and implement practices to reduce nutrient runoff (for example, 
slow-release fertilizers, optimized application timing for plant uptake). 
• 
Where appropriate, implement systems of practices in a treatment train to provide multiple pollutant 
removal processes (for example, runoff reduction through evapotranspiration and infiltration, 
sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, biological degradation, or uptake) to reduce the concentrations of 
pollutants in precipitation runoff and to provide redundancy in the system. 
• 
Use soil and vegetation-based controls based on their capacity to reduce precipitation runoff and 
pollutant loadings through evapotranspiration and phytoremediation. 
Project teams must provide the S+R Coordinator with the following onsite stormwater management 
documentation: 

• 
Site plan and a detailed description of all stormwater management strategies in the project and their 
function and performance features in infiltrating, evapotranspirating, reusing, or treating to the 
specified requirements above 
• 
Detailed treatment plans including volumetric capacity and removal efficiency for target pollutants 
including suspended solids, metals (zinc, copper, lead, and other heavy metals) and contaminants 
(nitrogen, phosphorous, fecal coliform, and petroleum hydrocarbons) 
• 
SWPPP for all construction activities; refer to 01 57 23 for SWPPP information and requirements

DIVISION 33 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

33 46 23 Modular Buried Stormwater Storage Units 

Where base development plans limit the space available for above-ground storage facilities for 
stormwater management underground structured systems may be used. Structures may be cast in place 
concrete vaults, manufactured modular units made of concrete or HDPE, or pipes. All systems must be 
designed to manage the runoff from the appropriate design storm, support a H-20 loading at a minimum 
(a higher loading requirement may be required by the base dependent on the expected uses of the 
associated facility), water quality management is provided by use of a pretreatment system or an open 
bottom system which allows infiltration is selected. 

33 70 00 ELECTRICAL UTILITIES 

The resiliency and sustainability of electric power will be enhanced by implementing high speed switching 
and protective capabilities to the transmission and distribution systems. Such devices allow electric power 
to follow alternative paths during emergency conditions. 

33 71 00 Electrical Utility Transmission and Distribution 

All electrical distribution must be installed underground. At a minimum, underground distribution must be 
6-way PVC duct encased in concrete. All conductors must be copper. Medium-voltage conductors must 
be MV105, 133%, ethylene propylene rubber insulation. At a minimum, provide one spare conduit. 
Conduit must be at a minimum 6-inch PVC Schedule 40 for medium-voltage power conductors. Conduit 
must be at a minimum 4-inch PVC Schedule 40 for low-voltage power conductors. Conduit must be at a 
minimum 2-inch PVC Schedule 40 for communications/control conductors. 

All potentially exposed electric utility transmission and distribution will be designed to withstand winds of 
Risk Category IV (170 mph). 

33 73 00 Utility Transformers 

Transformer enclosures must be constructed of corrosion-resistant material, such as marine grade 
aluminum or stainless steel. 

Transformers must be installed at an elevation no less than the DFE, or must be specifically designed, 
constructed, and installed to prevent floodwaters from entering or accumulating within components. 
(USAF, 2019b.) 

All utility transformers will be designed to withstand winds of Risk Category IV (170 mph). 

33 77 00 Medium-Voltage Utility Switchgear and Protection Devices 

Switchgear enclosures must be constructed of corrosion-resistant material, such as marine-grade 
aluminum or stainless steel. 

Metal-clad switchgear must be IEEE C37.20.7 Type 2 Arc-Resistant. 

Switchgear must be installed at an elevation no less than the DFE, or must be specifically designed, 
constructed, and installed to prevent floodwaters from entering or accumulating within components. 
(USAF, 2019b.) 

Pad-mounted medium-voltage switchgear must be dead front design. Each switchgear must have a 
minimum of two switched ways and two protected ways. The switched ways must be equipped with motor 
operators, batteries, current transformers, and fault indicators. The fault indicators must have a normally 
open contact that toggles under fault indication for external monitoring. Each switchgear must be 

04 October 2019 


IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 33 

equipped with a microprocessor-based protective relay. The relay must be capable of opening or closing 
both the switched ways and protected ways. The relay must operate the protected ways under fault 
conditions. The relay must be wired for switch status, protected way status, and fault indicator status. The 
relay must be capable of SCADA communications using IEEE 61850 over fiber. Each switchgear must be 
arranged in a loop configuration with switched ways connecting to other switches or the substation and 
protected ways feeding buildings or other loads looped back to another switchgear protected way with a 
normally open point in the center of that loop. Each normally open point will be approximately splitting the 
loop load in half. If a fault develops between any two switches, the substation will operate, isolating that 
loop. The two switches closest to the fault will open, the normally open point will close, refeeding the 
system once the substation recloses that feeder. For a fault on the protected ways, the relays must open 
the protected ways closest to the fault and close the normally open point refeeding the loads. The SCADA 
system must be capable of operating each switch or protected way for load shedding of non-critical loads 
under utility failures. 

All medium-voltage switchgear and protective devices will be designed to withstand winds of Risk 
Category IV (170 mph).

DIVISION 34 TRANSPORTATION 

The Transportation System is designed to provide system protection and facilitate continuous operations. 
This is achieved through minimal use of traffic signal systems. Instead, roundabouts must provide access 
control at arterial intersections. Safety and access are improved through the use of sidewalks and shared-
use paths for people walking or riding bikes. Life-cycle impacts of the transportation system are reduced 
for new construction through the use of hardened pavements for vehicular roadways and the use of 
recycled asphalt for the shared-use paths. Roadway lighting used must be controlled and controllable to 
power down when not needed to save energy and power up in case of emergency. 

34 70 00 TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT 

34 71 00 Roadway Construction 

The hierarchy of streets must be based on the master road network plan. Technical information for the 
design standards must be provided by the Geotechnical Team. The network consists of the three road 
types: 

1) Heavy Haul Road 
2) Arterial Street 
3) Shared Use Path 
The arterial street and heavy haul road must include travel lanes, at-grade 2-foot “ribbon” concrete curb, 
buffer (which is some cases may include bioretention swales), shared-use path, or sidewalk, and utility 
corridor. The primary difference between an arterial street and a heavy haul road is the pavement 
materials and depth. The heavy haul street must have pavement designed to withstand heavy truck traffic 
(AASHTO H25/HS25). The shared-use path must use reclaimed asphalt from the site. 

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 

See Division 25, Integrated Automation. 

Curb And Gutter 

Roadways must incorporate at-grade 2-foot “ribbon” concrete curb to allow for water to flow from street to 
bioretention swale. 

Street Lighting 

See Division 26, Electrical. 

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities 

In addition to UFC standards, design of pedestrian facilities, shared use paths, and bicycle facilities must 
refer to Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Design Manuals 222 – Pedestrian Facilities, 223 – 
Bicycle Facilities, and 224 – Shared Use Paths, as well as Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for 
Streets and Highways (MUTCD) or AASHTO Guidelines for Bicycle Facilities, whichever is more stringent 
for design of paths including pavement marking and signage. 

Intersection Configuration 

Intersection configuration must encourage passive systems such as roundabouts in lieu of signalized 
intersections. Aggressively pursue passive systems to lower maintenance requirements and reduce 
energy use. Design traffic signal mast arms and related traffic control devices (such as traffic signal

devices and signs) for the program wind speed requirements (USAF, 2019a) and as provided in the 
Miami-Dade NOA. In addition to UFC standards, refer to FDOT Design Manual for design of roundabouts 
(213 – Modern Roundabouts) 

Paving Materials 

See Division 32, Exterior Improvements 

Entry Control Facilities must be designed in accordance with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center’s 
Facilities Dynamic Prototypes Design: Entry Control Facilities/Installation Access Control Points 
(ECF/ACP) dated March 1, 2015. 

The following modifications must be made to the Installation Facility Standards dated 5 November 2019: 

• 
Deviate: Cross Section for Arterial Street (B02.1.1) must not follow illustration. 
• 
Add: Heavy Haul Road Arterial Cross-Section: 
– Two travel lanes (12-feet wide each) Portland cement concrete pavement, no median, concrete 
ribbon (2-feet wide) curb, parallel shared use path (10-foot wide), safety buffer, and future utility 
corridor (20-feet wide). 
• 
Add: Standard Road Arterial Cross-Section 
– Two Lane: travel lanes (12-feet) hardened asphalt, no median, concrete ribbon (2-feet), shared 
use path (10-feet), safety buffer, and future utility corridor (20-feet). 
– Four Lane: travel lane (12-feet) hardened asphalt, no median, concrete ribbon (2-feet), shared 
use path (10-feet), safety buffer, and future utility corridor (20-feet). 
Cross-section for 10-feet shared use path must use reheated 100% reclaimed asphalt mix. In addition to 
UFC, refer to FDOT, MUTCO, and AASHTO for shared use path pavement markings and signing

DIVISION 35 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft 

• 
Seal every utility, including electrical and telecommunications conduits, sanitary sewer and 
stormwater infrastructure, to prevent infiltration during a storm surge event. 
• 
Consider the need to install backflow prevention devices, duckbills, or tidal check valves in 
stormwater infrastructure to prevent tidal and surge flooding of stormwater infrastructure. This should 
be paired with a high onsite precipitation capture given the potential for backup or overflow during 
high precipitation events. 
• 
Increase the durability of structures: Strengthen foundations, floor slabs, and walls to resist 
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and buoyant forces. 
• 
Use building and structural materials resistant to saltwater, flooding, heat, cold, wind, and UV light, 
but environmentally safe. 
• 
Free the areas below the lowest floor of elevated buildings of obstructions or ensure that any 
enclosed areas constructed of non-supporting breakaway walls, open lattice-work, or screening will 
not cause building collapse, displacement, or other damage to the building foundation if impacted by 
or lost due to wave forcing in areas within or near the current limits of moderate wave action (LiMVA), 
which includes FEMA A and V zones. 
• 
Develop, where appropriate, landscape-scale storm-surge and wave damage risk reduction features, 
including upland strategies that reduce the impacts of flooding and waves on vulnerable assets, such 
as vegetated upland berms connected with high elevation points, floodwalls integrated into the 
landscape, raising edge elevation, or other landscape features. 
• 
Employ nature-based features as feasible to reduce wave damage from smaller, more frequent 
storms, including wetland, mangrove, coastal shrubland, and edge forest. 
• 
Use shoreline edge materials for stabilization that have a chemical composition, alkalinity, toxicity, 
pH, and other features that support the native biological community and attachment of characteristic 
marine organisms. 
• 
Design and enhance structural features to provide more heterogeneity and habitat-supporting 
complexity than conventional stabilization methods by using rough, textured, surfaces or varied sizes 
of rock that create interstitial spaces of varied size and shape, using a material with a pH that fosters 
attachment or provides refugia for native aquatic organisms. 
• 
Use water-retaining ecological features to increase diversity of habitat and maintain some intertidal 
zonation, such as precast tide pools. 
• 
Incorporate nature-based features that provide multiple benefits, such as tiered, reinforced edges with 
native plantings, oysters, mussels, and salt marsh. 
• 
Incorporate temporary stabilization strategies for wave attenuation and erosion reduction until 
vegetation is established. 
35 31 00 Shoreline Protection 

All design activities related to Shoreline Protection must be conducted in collaboration with USFWS within 
the guidelines of the Tyndall AFB INRMP. Project teams must assess and develop opportunities for 
integrating Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) in all Shoreline Protection designs. Examples of 
NNBF include beaches and dunes; vegetated environments such as maritime forests, salt marshes, 
freshwater wetlands and fluvial flood plains, and seagrass beds; coral and oyster reefs; and barrier 
islands, among others. These features may occur naturally in landscapes or be engineered, constructed, 
and/or restored to mimic natural conditions. For more information see the USACE Engineering With 
Nature website: https://ewn.el.erdc.dren.mil/nnbf.html
